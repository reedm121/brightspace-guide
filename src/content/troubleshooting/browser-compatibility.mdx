# Browser Compatibility

## Overview

Brightspace is designed to work with modern web browsers, but ensuring you have the right browser and settings configured correctly is essential for a smooth experience. This guide covers supported browsers, recommended settings, and solutions to common browser-related problems.

<Callout type="info" title="Recommended Browser">
D2L recommends using the latest version of **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox** for the best Brightspace experience. These browsers receive the most testing and have the fewest reported issues.
</Callout>

## Supported Browsers and Versions

Brightspace supports the latest stable versions of the following browsers:

| Browser | Minimum Version | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Google Chrome | 129+ | Recommended for best compatibility |
| Mozilla Firefox | 130+ | Excellent alternative to Chrome |
| Microsoft Edge | 129+ | Chromium-based Edge works well |
| Apple Safari | 18+ | May require additional configuration |

### Legacy Browser Support

Brightspace can be accessed with older browser versions (legacy browsers), but D2L does not actively test against them. If you use a legacy browser, you may encounter:

- Unexpected user interface behavior
- Visual appearance issues
- Broken or unsupported functionality
- "Unsupported Browser" warnings

### Blocked Browsers

The following browsers are explicitly blocked and will not work with Brightspace:

- Microsoft Internet Explorer (all versions)
- Microsoft Edge Legacy (non-Chromium version)

<Callout type="danger" title="Internet Explorer Not Supported">
Internet Explorer is completely unsupported. If you are still using IE, you must switch to a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or the new Chromium-based Edge to access Brightspace.
</Callout>

## Recommended Browser Settings

To ensure Brightspace works correctly, configure your browser with these settings:

### Required Settings

1. **JavaScript must be enabled** - Brightspace relies heavily on JavaScript for interactivity
2. **Cookies must be enabled** - Session management requires cookies
3. **Pop-ups should be allowed** for your Brightspace domain
4. **Third-party cookies** may be required for integrated tools

### Checking Your Browser Settings

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify JavaScript is enabled">
JavaScript is enabled by default in all modern browsers. If you have disabled it, re-enable it in your browser settings. In Chrome, go to Settings > Privacy and security > Site settings > JavaScript.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable cookies">
Ensure cookies are not blocked. In Chrome, navigate to Settings > Privacy and security > Cookies and other site data. Select "Allow all cookies" or add your Brightspace domain to the allowed list.
</Step>

<Step title="Allow pop-ups for Brightspace">
Some features open in new windows. Add your institution's Brightspace URL (e.g., `https://yourschool.brightspace.com`) to the allowed sites for pop-ups.
</Step>

<Step title="Disable content blockers for Brightspace">
Ad blockers and privacy extensions can interfere with Brightspace functionality. Add your Brightspace domain to the allowlist for these extensions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Clearing Cache and Cookies

Many Brightspace issues are resolved by clearing your browser's cached data. Cached files can become outdated and cause display or functionality problems.

### How to Clear Cache in Each Browser

<Steps>
<Step title="Google Chrome">
1. Click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner
2. Select **Settings**
3. Click **Privacy and security** in the left menu
4. Click **Clear browsing data**
5. Set time range to "All time"
6. Check "Cached images and files" and "Cookies and other site data"
7. Click **Clear data**
8. Close and reopen Chrome
</Step>

<Step title="Mozilla Firefox">
1. Click the menu button (three horizontal lines)
2. Select **Settings**
3. Click **Privacy & Security** in the left menu
4. Under "Cookies and Site Data," click **Clear Data**
5. Check both boxes and click **Clear**
6. Close and reopen Firefox
</Step>

<Step title="Microsoft Edge">
1. Click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner
2. Select **Settings**
3. Click **Privacy, search, and services**
4. Under "Clear browsing data," click **Choose what to clear**
5. Set time range to "All time"

2. Select **Settings** (or Preferences)
3. Click the **Privacy** tab
4. Click **Manage Website Data**
5. Search for your Brightspace domain and remove it, or click **Remove All**
6. Close and reopen Safari
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Refresh">
Before clearing all cache, try a hard refresh first. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) to reload the page without cached data.
</Callout>

## Disabling Extensions That Interfere

Browser extensions can block Brightspace functionality, especially ad blockers, privacy tools, and VPN extensions.

### Common Problematic Extensions

- Ad blockers (uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus, etc.)
- Privacy extensions (Privacy Badger, Ghostery)
- Script blockers (NoScript, ScriptSafe)
- VPN extensions
- PDF viewers that intercept downloads

### How to Identify and Disable Problematic Extensions

<Steps>
<Step title="Test in Incognito or Private mode">
Open Brightspace in an incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N in Chrome) or private window (Ctrl+Shift+P in Firefox). If Brightspace works correctly, an extension is likely causing the issue.
</Step>

<Step title="Disable extensions one by one">
In Chrome, go to **chrome://extensions** and toggle off extensions one at a time. Test Brightspace after each one to identify the culprit.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Brightspace to extension allowlists">
Instead of completely disabling an extension, add your Brightspace URL to its allowlist. Most ad blockers have an option to "trust" or "pause on this site."
</Step>

<Step title="Keep essential extensions only">
Remove extensions you no longer use. More extensions mean more potential conflicts and slower browser performance.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Ad Blockers and Zoom">
Many ad blockers detect the Zoom integration in Brightspace as a tracker and block it. If Zoom is not working in Brightspace, check your ad blocker settings first.
</Callout>

## Pop-up Blocker Settings

Brightspace and its integrated tools often require pop-up windows. If pop-ups are blocked, you may experience issues with:

- External learning tools (LTI integrations)
- Quiz launches in new windows
- File downloads
- Microsoft 365 integrations
- Zoom and video tools

### Allowing Pop-ups for Brightspace

<Steps>
<Step title="Chrome">
1. Go to **Settings > Privacy and security > Site settings > Pop-ups and redirects**
2. Under "Allowed to send pop-ups and use redirects," click **Add**
3. Enter your Brightspace URL (e.g., `https://yourschool.brightspace.com`)
4. Click **Add**
</Step>

<Step title="Firefox">
1. Go to **Settings > Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll to "Permissions" and find "Block pop-up windows"
3. Click **Exceptions** next to it
4. Enter your Brightspace URL and click **Allow**
5. Click **Save Changes**
</Step>

<Step title="Edge">
1. Go to **Settings > Cookies and site permissions > Pop-ups and redirects**
2. Under "Allow," click **Add**
3. Enter your Brightspace URL
4. Click **Add**
</Step>

<Step title="Safari">
1. Open Safari Preferences/Settings
2. Go to the **Websites** tab
3. Select **Pop-up Windows** from the left sidebar
4. Find your Brightspace site and change the setting to **Allow**
</Step>
</Steps>

## JavaScript Requirements

Brightspace requires JavaScript to be enabled for nearly all functionality. Without JavaScript, you will see a non-functional or blank page.

### Verifying JavaScript is Enabled

In most browsers, JavaScript is enabled by default. However, if you or your IT department have disabled it:

**Chrome:**
1. Go to **Settings > Privacy and security > Site settings > JavaScript**
2. Ensure "Sites can use JavaScript" is selected
3. Verify your Brightspace domain is not in the "Not allowed to use JavaScript" list

**Firefox:**
1. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter
2. Search for `javascript.enabled`
3. Ensure it is set to `true`

**Safari:**
1. Go to **Safari > Settings > Security**
2. Ensure "Enable JavaScript" is checked

<Callout type="info" title="JavaScript Errors">
If you see JavaScript errors in Brightspace, clearing your browser cache often resolves them. Outdated cached JavaScript files can conflict with updated Brightspace code.
</Callout>

## Browser-Specific Issues

### Safari Issues

Safari users frequently encounter problems that do not occur in other browsers. Known issues include:

- Media playback problems with Kaltura videos
- Third-party tool integration failures (Zoom, LockDown Browser)
- Cross-site tracking blocking essential cookies
- File upload inconsistencies

<Steps>
<Step title="Disable Prevent Cross-Site Tracking">
Go to **Safari > Settings > Privacy** and uncheck **Prevent cross-site tracking**. This setting blocks cookies that many Brightspace integrations require.
</Step>

<Step title="Allow cookies from Brightspace">
In the same Privacy settings, ensure **Block all cookies** is unchecked. You can also click **Manage Website Data** to verify cookies are stored for your Brightspace domain.
</Step>

<Step title="Consider using Chrome or Firefox">
If Safari issues persist, D2L recommends switching to Chrome or Firefox for accessing Brightspace. These browsers have better compatibility with Brightspace features and integrations.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Safari Known Limitation">
D2L is aware of ongoing compatibility issues with Safari. While they work to resolve them, using Chrome or Firefox is the most reliable solution for Mac users.
</Callout>

### Firefox Issues

Firefox occasionally has issues with:

- Certain rich content editors
- Drag-and-drop file uploads
- Some LTI tool integrations

**Solution:** Ensure Enhanced Tracking Protection is set to "Standard" rather than "Strict" for your Brightspace domain. Click the shield icon in the address bar and adjust settings for the site.

### Edge Issues

Microsoft Edge based on Chromium generally works well with Brightspace. However:

- Ensure you are using the new Chromium-based Edge, not Edge Legacy
- Check that the browser is up to date
- Configure third-party cookie settings similar to Chrome

## Mobile Browser Limitations

Accessing Brightspace through mobile browsers (Safari on iOS, Chrome on Android) works for basic navigation and content viewing, but has limitations.

### What Works on Mobile Browsers

- Viewing course content and announcements
- Reading discussion posts
- Checking grades
- Viewing the calendar
- Basic navigation

### What May Not Work on Mobile Browsers

- Taking quizzes and exams (especially proctored)
- Complex file uploads
- Some LTI tool integrations
- Interactive content (H5P, SCORM)
- Full editing capabilities

### Mobile Browser Tips

<Steps>
<Step title="Use desktop mode when needed">
Most mobile browsers have a "Request Desktop Site" option. This can help with features that do not display correctly in mobile view.
</Step>

<Step title="Disable cross-site tracking (iOS Safari)">
On iPhone/iPad, go to **Settings > Safari** and turn off **Prevent Cross-Site Tracking**. This affects all websites but is often necessary for Brightspace.
</Step>

<Step title="Keep your mobile browser updated">
Mobile browsers update frequently. Ensure automatic updates are enabled to get the latest compatibility fixes.
</Step>

<Step title="Consider the Brightspace Pulse app">
For mobile access, the Brightspace Pulse app provides a better experience than mobile browsers for common tasks like checking due dates and viewing announcements. However, it also has limitations for quizzes and complex activities.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Tablet Recommendation">
If you frequently use Brightspace on a tablet, consider using a Bluetooth keyboard for easier text entry and treat it more like a laptop experience for full functionality.
</Callout>

## Testing in Different Browsers

Before reporting an issue to IT support, test the problem in a different browser. This helps identify whether the issue is browser-specific or a broader Brightspace problem.

### Testing Checklist

<Steps>
<Step title="Reproduce the issue">
Document exactly what you were doing when the problem occurred. Note the steps, any error messages, and what you expected to happen.
</Step>

<Step title="Clear cache in your current browser">
Try clearing cache and cookies first, then attempt the action again.
</Step>

<Step title="Test in Incognito/Private mode">
Open a private browsing window in your current browser. This tests without extensions and with fresh cookies.
</Step>

<Step title="Test in a different browser">
Open Brightspace in Chrome if you normally use Firefox, or vice versa. Repeat the steps that caused the issue.
</Step>

<Step title="Document your findings">
Note which browser(s) have the issue and which do not. This information is valuable for IT support.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Comparing Browser Behavior

| Test Scenario | If Issue Persists | If Issue Resolves |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Same browser, cleared cache | Extension or deeper browser issue | Caching issue - resolved |
| Same browser, incognito mode | Browser or Brightspace issue | Extension conflict |
| Different browser | Brightspace or account issue | Browser-specific issue |
| Different computer | Account or Brightspace system issue | Computer-specific issue |

## When to Switch Browsers

Consider switching browsers if you experience:

- Persistent issues that clearing cache does not fix
- Problems only occurring in one specific browser
- Slow performance or freezing
- Features that do not work despite correct settings
- Frequent JavaScript or loading errors

### Recommended Browser Order

If you are having persistent issues, try browsers in this order:

1. **Google Chrome** - Best overall compatibility
2. **Mozilla Firefox** - Excellent alternative with strong privacy features
3. **Microsoft Edge** (Chromium) - Good option for Windows users
4. **Apple Safari** - Use only if other browsers are not available

<Callout type="tip" title="Browser Profiles">
If you must use a specific browser for other work but need a different one for Brightspace, create a separate browser profile or use a portable browser installation just for Brightspace.
</Callout>

## Summary: Quick Troubleshooting Steps

When you encounter browser issues in Brightspace:

1. **Refresh** - Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear cache** - Clear browser cache and cookies
