# Mobile App (Brightspace Pulse)

## Overview

Brightspace Pulse is the official mobile app for Brightspace, available for both iOS and Android devices. It provides a convenient way to stay connected with your courses, view deadlines, check grades, and receive notifications on the go. However, it is important to understand that Pulse is a companion app with significant limitations - it is not a substitute for the full Brightspace web experience.

<Callout type="warning" title="Important for Instructors">
The Brightspace Pulse app is designed primarily for the student viewing experience. While instructors can use it to check content and view student progress, you should always create and edit course content using a desktop browser. Many instructor tools are not available in the app.
</Callout>

## Downloading Brightspace Pulse

The app is free to download and available on both major mobile platforms.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your device's app store">
On iOS, open the App Store. On Android, open Google Play Store.
</Step>

<Step title="Search for Brightspace Pulse">
Type "Brightspace Pulse" in the search bar. The app icon is a white "D" on an orange background.
</Step>

<Step title="Download and install">
Tap "Get" (iOS) or "Install" (Android) to download the app. It requires approximately 100MB of storage space.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the app and find your institution">
Launch the app and search for your institution's name. Select it from the list to be directed to your institution's login page.
</Step>

<Step title="Log in with your credentials">
Enter your institution credentials (typically the same as your Brightspace web login). You may be redirected through your institution's Single Sign-On (SSO) system.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Multiple Accounts">
Pulse supports logging into multiple Brightspace accounts simultaneously. This is useful if you teach at multiple institutions or have both a student and instructor account.

### Content Without Dates

<Callout type="warning" title="Hidden Content">

## Common Mobile Issues

### App Crashes on Login

<Steps>
<Step title="Update the app">
Check your app store for updates to Brightspace Pulse. Outdated versions may have compatibility issues.
</Step>

<Step title="Clear app data">
On Android: Settings > Apps > Brightspace Pulse > Storage > Clear Data
On iOS: Delete and reinstall the app
</Step>

<Step title="Try logging in via web first">
Sometimes logging into Brightspace through your mobile browser first, then opening the app, resolves authentication issues.
</Step>
</Steps>

### SSO Login Loops

If you are stuck in a login loop with your institution's Single Sign-On:

1. Clear the Pulse app cache/data
2. Clear your mobile browser cache and cookies
3. Log into Brightspace through your mobile browser
4. Then try opening the Pulse app

### Missing Content or Announcements

<Callout type="info" title="Content Visibility">
Items without dates may not appear in Pulse. If you cannot find expected content, access Brightspace through a web browser to see all course materials.
</Callout>

### Notifications Not Appearing

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No notifications at all | Check device notification settings for Pulse |
| Missing specific notifications | Verify in-app notification preferences |
| Delayed notifications | Notifications can take up to an hour; this is normal |
| Discussion notifications missing | Subscribe to topics via web browser first |

### Third-Party Tools Not Working

McGraw Hill Connect, Pearson MyLab, Cengage MindTap, and similar publisher integrations do not work in Pulse. You must access these tools through the Brightspace web interface.

### Browser Redirects

Many actions in Pulse will open a Safari or Chrome browser window. This is expected behavior for features not natively supported in the app. If the browser window appears blank or stuck:

1. Close the browser window
2. Clear your mobile browser cache
3. Try the action again, or access it directly through your mobile browser

## When to Use Web vs App

Understanding when to use each platform ensures the best experience.

### Use the Web Browser (Desktop/Laptop) For:

- Taking quizzes and exams (mandatory)
- Submitting assignments
- Participating in discussions
- Viewing interactive or embedded content
- Accessing third-party publisher tools
- Creating and editing course content (instructors)
- Managing grades and gradebook (instructors)
- Configuring course settings (instructors)
- Any high-stakes academic activity

### Use the Pulse App For:

- Checking upcoming deadlines quickly
- Viewing grades when they are posted
- Reading announcements
- Downloading content for offline reading
- Getting push notifications on the go
- Quick reference to course materials
- Checking student progress (instructors)
- General course awareness while away from a computer

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
Think of Pulse as a "read-only" companion to Brightspace. Use it to stay informed and check information, but switch to a desktop browser for any interactive tasks or submissions.
