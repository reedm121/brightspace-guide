# Discussions

## What are Discussions in Brightspace?

The Discussions tool in Brightspace provides a space for **asynchronous communication** between students and instructors. Unlike live chat or video calls, discussions allow participants to post messages, reply to others, and engage in conversations at their own pace—making them ideal for thoughtful, in-depth exchanges that don't require everyone to be online simultaneously.

Discussions are one of the most versatile tools in Brightspace, supporting everything from casual introductions to graded academic debates.

## Why Use Discussions?

Discussions serve several important purposes in online and hybrid courses:

| Purpose | Example Use Case |
|---------|------------------|
| **Build Community** | "Introduce Yourself" forums help students connect |
| **Extend Learning** | Discuss readings, lectures, or case studies |
| **Peer Learning** | Students learn from each other's perspectives |
| **Assess Participation** | Grade student engagement and critical thinking |
| **Q&A Support** | Create spaces for questions about course content |
| **Group Collaboration** | Private discussion spaces for group projects |

<Callout type="tip" title="Pedagogical Value">
Research shows that well-designed discussions promote deeper learning by requiring students to articulate their thinking, consider alternative viewpoints, and engage with course material beyond passive reading.

## Understanding the Discussion Hierarchy

Brightspace organizes discussions into three levels:

```
Forum (Container)
└── Topic (Discussion Prompt)
    └── Threads (Student Posts & Replies)
```

- **Forums** are organizational containers—like folders for grouping related discussions
- **Topics** contain the actual discussion prompts where students participate
- **Threads** are individual posts created by students and their subsequent replies

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistake">
Students cannot post directly to a Forum—you must create at least one Topic within a forum for students to participate. This is the most common source of confusion for new Brightspace users.

## Key Features

### Participation Controls
- **Must Post First**: Require students to share their own thoughts before seeing peer responses
- **Anonymous Posting**: Let students hide their identity from classmates (instructors still see names)
- **Moderation**: Require instructor approval before posts become visible

### Grading Integration
- Connect discussions to grade items for participation grades
- Attach rubrics for consistent evaluation criteria
- Track student participation with built-in analytics

### Flexible Access
- Set availability dates to control when discussions open and close
- Use release conditions to unlock discussions based on other activities
- Restrict discussions to specific groups or course sections

### Rich Content
- Students can format text, embed images, and attach files
- Support for video and audio recordings directly in posts
- Threaded replies keep conversations organized

## Accessing Discussions

To access the Discussions tool in your course:

1. From your course navbar, click **Tools** (or **Activities** depending on your institution's setup)
2. Select **Discussions** from the dropdown menu

Alternatively, if your navbar has a direct **Discussions** link, click it to go directly to the tool.

## Best Practices

### Designing Effective Discussion Prompts
- Ask open-ended questions that invite multiple perspectives
- Connect prompts to course learning objectives
- Provide clear expectations for length, format, and response requirements
- Include a deadline for initial posts AND replies to peers

### Managing Large Classes
- Consider using group discussions to create smaller conversation spaces
- Enable "Must Post First" to encourage original thinking
- Use the moderation queue selectively (it requires significant instructor time)

### Encouraging Quality Participation
- Model good discussion behavior with instructor posts
- Provide specific feedback on early posts to set expectations
- Consider peer rating features to highlight quality contributions

## Common Questions

**Can students edit or delete their posts?**
By default, students can edit their posts but not delete them. You can adjust these settings in the forum or topic options.

**Can I copy discussions from another course?**
Yes, discussions are included when you copy course content. However, all student posts are removed—only the forum structure and topic prompts are copied.

**How do I see who hasn't posted yet?**
Use the **Statistics** view within a discussion topic to see participation data, including who has and hasn't contributed.
