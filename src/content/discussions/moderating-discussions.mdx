# Moderating Discussions

## Overview

Effective discussion moderation ensures productive, respectful conversations in your online course. Brightspace provides comprehensive moderation tools that allow you to require post approval before visibility, edit or delete inappropriate content, lock discussions after deadlines, pin important threads, and track participation through built-in analytics. This guide covers all moderation features and best practices for managing student discussions.

## Before You Begin

- You must have Instructor or TA permissions in the course
- Discussion forums and topics should already be created
- Decide on your moderation approach before students begin posting
- Consider communicating expectations to students in your syllabus or discussion instructions

<Callout type="info" title="Moderation Commitment">
Enabling post approval requires ongoing attention to approve pending posts promptly. For large classes, consider whether the benefits of moderation outweigh the time investment, or limit moderation to sensitive topics only.
</Callout>

## Enabling Post Approval/Moderation

When moderation is enabled, student posts are hidden from classmates until you explicitly approve them. This is useful for sensitive topics, guest discussions, or when you want to review content before it becomes visible.

<Steps>

<Step title="Access Forum or Topic Settings">
1. Navigate to **Tools** > **Discussions** from your course navbar
2. Locate the forum or topic you want to moderate
3. Click the dropdown arrow next to the name
4. Select **Edit Forum** or **Edit Topic**
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Moderation">
1. Expand the **Options** section (for forums) or **Post & Completion** section (for topics)
2. Check the box for **A moderator must approve individual posts before they display in the forum/topic**
   - This may also be labeled "Posts must be approved before they display"
3. Click **Save and Close**
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Moderation is Active">
After saving, a **Moderated** badge appears next to the forum or topic name. This indicates that all new posts require approval before other students can see them.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Forum vs Topic Level">
Settings applied at the forum level affect ALL topics within that forum. If you only need moderation for specific discussions, apply the setting at the topic level instead. You cannot override forum-level moderation settings on individual topics.
</Callout>

### Who Can Approve Posts?

Users with approval permissions can create posts that display automatically. This typically includes:
- Instructors
- Teaching Assistants (TAs)
- Users with the "Approve Discussions" permission

Students and other users without approval permissions will see a "Requires Approval" message after submitting their posts.

## Reviewing Pending Posts

When moderation is enabled, you must actively check for and review pending posts to keep discussions flowing.

<Steps>

<Step title="Access the Moderation Queue">
1. Navigate to **Tools** > **Discussions**
2. Click on the moderated forum or topic
3. Look for a notification indicator showing the number of pending posts
4. Posts awaiting approval appear with a "Pending" or "Requires Approval" status
</Step>

<Step title="View Pending Posts">
1. Click on individual pending threads to read the full content
2. Review the post for appropriateness, relevance, and adherence to discussion guidelines
3. Note the author and timestamp for context
</Step>

<Step title="Filter for Unapproved Posts">
Use the filter or sort options to show only unapproved posts, making it easier to find items needing your attention in busy discussions.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Check Regularly">
Students may become frustrated if their posts sit unapproved for long periods. Set a schedule to check moderated discussions at least once daily, or more frequently for active discussions.
</Callout>

## Approving or Rejecting Posts

Once you have reviewed pending posts, you can approve them to make them visible, or take other actions for inappropriate content.

<Steps>

<Step title="Approve Individual Posts">
1. Click on the pending post to open it
2. Click the **Actions** menu (dropdown arrow or three dots)
3. Select **Approve** to make the post visible to all students
4. The post immediately appears in the discussion for everyone to see
</Step>

<Step title="Approve Multiple Posts at Once">
1. From the topic view, click **Approve/Unapprove All threads**
2. This option appears only when moderation is enabled
3. All pending threads within the topic are approved simultaneously

<Callout type="warning" title="Review First">
Only use bulk approval if you have reviewed all pending posts. Once approved, posts are immediately visible to the entire class.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Inappropriate Posts">
If a post is not appropriate, you have several options:
- **Leave unapproved**: The post remains visible only to you and the author
- **Edit before approving**: Modify the content, then approve the edited version
- **Delete the post**: Remove it entirely from the discussion
- **Contact the student**: Reach out privately to explain why the post was not approved
</Step>

<Step title="Unapprove a Previously Approved Post">
If you need to hide a post that was already approved:
1. Locate the post in the discussion
2. Click the **Actions** menu
3. Select **Unapprove**
4. The post becomes hidden from students again
</Step>

</Steps>

## Editing Student Posts

As an instructor, you can edit any student post directly. This is useful for removing inappropriate content, correcting formatting issues, or redacting sensitive information.

<Steps>

<Step title="Locate the Post">
1. Navigate to the discussion topic
2. Find the specific post you need to edit
3. Click on the post to expand it if necessary
</Step>

<Step title="Edit the Post">
1. Click the **Actions** menu (dropdown or three dots) on the post
2. Select **Edit**
3. Make your changes in the text editor
4. Click **Save** or **Update**
</Step>

<Step title="Notify the Student (Recommended)">
Consider sending the student a private message explaining:
- What was edited and why
- Any expectations for future posts
- Resources for understanding discussion guidelines
</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Edit History">
Brightspace may track that a post was edited. Depending on your institution's settings, students might see an "Edited" indicator on modified posts. Changes are often recorded for accountability purposes.
</Callout>

## Deleting Inappropriate Content

When editing is not sufficient, you can delete posts or entire threads that violate discussion guidelines.

<Steps>

<Step title="Delete an Individual Post">
1. Locate the inappropriate post
2. Click the **Actions** menu
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted
</Step>

<Step title="Delete an Entire Thread">
1. Navigate to the thread you want to remove
2. Click the **Actions** menu on the original post (thread starter)
3. Select **Delete Thread** or **Delete**
4. Confirm the deletion

<Callout type="danger" title="Permanent Action">
Deleting a thread removes all replies within it. This action may be irreversible depending on your institution's settings. Consider unapproving or hiding content instead if you may need to reference it later.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Document the Deletion">
For serious violations:
1. Take a screenshot before deleting
2. Note the student name, date, and nature of the violation
3. Report to your department or administration if required by policy
4. Follow up with the student regarding conduct expectations
</Step>

</Steps>

### When to Delete vs Edit

| Situation | Recommended Action |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Minor inappropriate language | Edit to remove the specific words |
| Personal information accidentally shared | Edit to redact, notify student |
| Off-topic but not harmful | Leave a reply redirecting the conversation |
| Harassment or threats | Delete immediately, document, report |
| Academic integrity violation | Delete, document, follow institutional policy |
| Spam or promotional content | Delete the post |

## Locking Discussions

Locking prevents new posts while keeping existing content visible. This is useful after discussion deadlines or when a conversation has concluded.

<Steps>

<Step title="Access Locking Options">
1. Navigate to **Tools** > **Discussions**
2. Click the dropdown arrow next to the forum or topic
3. Select **Edit Forum** or **Edit Topic**
</Step>

<Step title="Set Manual Lock">
1. Expand the **Availability Dates & Conditions** or **Restrictions** section
2. Look for **Locking Options**
3. Select **Lock forum/topic** to immediately prevent new posts
4. Click **Save and Close**
</Step>

<Step title="Set Time-Based Locking">
For automatic locking after a deadline:
1. Set an **End Date** in the Availability section
2. Choose **Visible with submission restricted** for after the end date
3. Students can still read posts but cannot create new ones
4. This creates a read-only archive of the discussion
</Step>

<Step title="Unlock a Locked Discussion">
1. Edit the forum or topic settings
2. Select **Unlock forum/topic** in the Locking Options
3. Or remove/extend the End Date
4. Save your changes
</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
Use "Visible with submission restricted" after the end date rather than hiding discussions entirely. This allows students to review their contributions and peer responses even after the deadline passes.
</Callout>

### Locking Options Summary

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Unlock forum/topic** | Always open for new posts (default) |
| **Lock forum/topic** | Immediately closed, no new posts allowed |
| **Unlock for specific date range** | Open only during specified dates |
| **End Date with submission restricted** | Automatically locks after the deadline |

## Pinning Important Posts

Pinning keeps important threads at the top of the discussion, ensuring they remain visible regardless of other activity.

<Steps>

<Step title="Locate the Thread to Pin">
1. Navigate to the discussion topic
2. Find the thread you want to pin (could be your own or a student's)
</Step>

<Step title="Pin the Thread">
1. Click the **Actions** menu on the thread
2. Select **Pin Thread** or **Pin to Top**
3. The thread moves to the top of the topic and displays a pin icon
</Step>

<Step title="Unpin a Thread">
1. Click the **Actions** menu on the pinned thread
2. Select **Unpin Thread** or **Remove Pin**
3. The thread returns to its chronological position
</Step>

</Steps>

### When to Pin Threads

- **Discussion instructions or guidelines**: Pin your opening post with expectations
- **Important announcements**: Updates relevant to the discussion topic
- **Exemplary student posts**: Highlight excellent contributions as models
- **Summary posts**: Pin a wrap-up post after the discussion concludes
- **Frequently referenced information**: Resources students need to access repeatedly

<Callout type="info" title="Multiple Pins">
You can pin multiple threads in a single topic. Pinned threads appear in the order they were pinned, with the most recently pinned at the top of the pinned section.
</Callout>

## Discussion Analytics

Brightspace provides built-in statistics to help you track participation patterns and identify students who may need encouragement.

<Steps>

<Step title="Access Discussion Statistics">
1. Navigate to **Tools** > **Discussions**
2. Click the **Statistics** tab at the top of the Discussions tool

</Step>

</Steps>

### Using Statistics for Moderation

| Statistic | Moderation Insight |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Low thread count** | Student may need encouragement or assistance |
| **Many replies, few original posts** | Consider requiring original threads |
| **Posts read = 0** | Student is not engaging with peer content |
| **High activity, low quality** | May need individual feedback on post quality |
| **Votes received** | Indicates peer perception of contribution value |

<Callout type="warning" title="Limitations">
Brightspace statistics show user-level data but do not provide post-specific analytics (e.g., how many students read a particular post). For more detailed analytics, consider third-party discussion tools that integrate with Brightspace.
</Callout>

### Class Progress Integration

Discussion participation also appears in the Class Progress tool:

1. Navigate to **Progress** > **Class Progress**
2. Add "Discussion Participation" as one of your tracked indicators
3. View discussion activity alongside other engagement metrics
4. Identify at-risk students who are not participating across multiple areas

## Managing Difficult Discussions

Even with good planning, challenging situations can arise. Here are strategies for common scenarios.

### Heated or Controversial Topics

<Steps>

<Step title="Set Clear Expectations">
Before the discussion begins:
- Post discussion guidelines prominently
- Require respectful language and evidence-based arguments
- Explain consequences for violating guidelines
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor Actively">
- Check the discussion frequently during active periods
- Enable email notifications for new posts
- Respond quickly to emerging conflicts
</Step>

<Step title="Intervene When Needed">
- Post a reminder about discussion norms if tensions rise
- Move conversations back to the topic with guiding questions
- Reach out privately to students whose posts are problematic
- Lock the discussion temporarily if things get out of hand
</Step>

</Steps>

### Low Participation

<Steps>

<Step title="Diagnose the Cause">
- Check if instructions are clear
- Verify the discussion is visible and accessible
- Review if the topic is engaging
</Step>

<Step title="Encourage Engagement">
- Post follow-up questions to spark conversation
- Highlight interesting student contributions
- Send reminders about participation requirements
- Consider using "must post first" to ensure initial engagement
</Step>

<Step title="Adjust Requirements if Needed">
- Extend deadlines if appropriate
- Simplify prompts that may be confusing
- Reduce quantity requirements but maintain quality expectations
</Step>

</Steps>

### Dominant Participants

When a few students dominate the conversation:

- Set posting limits (e.g., maximum 3 posts per day initially)
- Use "must post first" so quieter students have time to formulate thoughts
- Privately thank dominant posters while encouraging them to allow others space
- Create structured turn-taking in your discussion prompts

### Off-Topic Posts

- Reply to redirect the conversation back on topic
- Move the post to a more appropriate forum if possible
- For persistent issues, contact the student privately
- Consider creating an "off-topic" forum for general conversation

## Best Practices for Moderation

### Before the Discussion

1. **Write clear guidelines**: Post expectations for tone, length, citations, and peer interaction
2. **Choose appropriate settings**: Decide on moderation, anonymous posting, and "must post first" based on your goals
3. **Create a welcoming opening**: Your initial post sets the tone for the entire discussion
4. **Set reasonable deadlines**: Allow enough time for meaningful peer interaction

### During the Discussion

1. **Be present but not dominant**: Participate enough to guide without taking over
2. **Respond to questions promptly**: Students may be waiting on clarification
3. **Acknowledge good contributions**: Public praise encourages quality posts
4. **Address problems early**: Small issues can escalate if ignored

### After the Discussion

1. **Post a summary**: Highlight key themes and excellent contributions
2. **Provide feedback**: Individual or group feedback on participation quality
3. **Lock appropriately**: Keep content visible but prevent further posts
4. **Reflect and improve**: Note what worked and what to change next time

<Callout type="tip" title="Moderation Checklist">
Create a recurring task to check each moderated discussion at consistent times. This ensures posts are approved promptly and issues are caught early.
</Callout>

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Posts stuck in moderation queue** | Check the topic regularly; consider disabling moderation for low-risk discussions |
| **Cannot find moderation option** | Ensure you have Instructor permissions; check both forum and topic settings |
| **Students complaining about deleted posts** | Document reasons; communicate decisions privately; establish clear guidelines upfront |
| **Discussion too quiet** | Add follow-up prompts; check visibility settings; send participation reminders |
| **Cannot edit a student's post** | Verify you have edit permissions; contact your administrator if the option is unavailable |
| **Locking not working** | Check that end dates are set correctly; verify no conflicting availability conditions |
| **Statistics not showing data** | Ensure students have actually posted; refresh the page; check for browser cache issues |
