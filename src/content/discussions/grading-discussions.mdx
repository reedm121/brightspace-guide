# Grading Discussions

## Overview

Brightspace provides robust tools for assessing student participation in discussions. You can grade discussions at the topic level, evaluate individual posts, use rubrics for consistent assessment, and track participation through built-in analytics. This guide covers everything you need to know about grading discussions effectively.

## Before You Begin

- You must have Instructor or TA permissions in the course
- A discussion topic must be created before you can set up grading
- You need a grade item in the Gradebook to link to graded discussions
- Consider creating a rubric before grading if you want standardized criteria

<Callout type="info" title="Key Requirement">
Grading individual discussion posts can only be done if the discussion topic has been linked to a grade item. Without this link, you can still view and moderate discussions, but grades will not transfer to the Gradebook.
</Callout>

## Setting Up Graded Discussions

To make a discussion topic gradable, you need to link it to a grade item and configure your assessment preferences.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Discussion Topic">
1. Navigate to **Tools** > **Discussions** from your course navbar
2. Locate the discussion topic you want to make gradable
3. Click the dropdown arrow next to the topic name
4. Select **Edit Topic**
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the Assessment Tab">
1. Click on the **Assessment** tab in the topic settings
2. In the **Grade Out Of** field, enter the maximum point value for this discussion
3. Choose one of the following options:
   - **Create and link to a new grade item**: Creates a new grade item automatically
   - **Link to an existing grade item**: Select from existing numeric grade items
4. Only numeric grade items can be linked to discussions
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Individual Post Evaluation (Optional)">
If you want to grade individual posts rather than giving an overall topic score:
1. Check **Allow assessment of individual posts**
2. Select a calculation method for combining post scores:
   - **Average post score**: Mean of all post scores
   - **Maximum post score**: Highest individual post score
   - **Minimum post score**: Lowest individual post score
   - **Mode post score**: Most frequently occurring score
   - **Sum of post scores**: Total of all post scores
</Step>

<Step title="Attach a Rubric (Optional)">
1. Click **Add Rubric** in the Assessment tab
2. Select an existing rubric from your course rubric library
3. Configure rubric visibility settings for students
4. Click **Save and Close**
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Planning Your Grading Approach">
Decide before the discussion begins whether you will grade the overall topic participation or individual posts. This affects how you configure the assessment settings and communicate expectations to students.
</Callout>

## Viewing Student Posts

Before grading, you need to review student contributions. Brightspace offers several ways to view discussion activity.

### From the Discussions Tool

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the Discussion Topic">
1. Go to **Tools** > **Discussions**
2. Click on the forum name to expand it
3. Click on the topic name to view all threads
</Step>

<Step title="View Individual Threads">
1. Click on any thread title to read the original post
2. Replies appear nested below the original post
3. Use the **Expand All** option to see all replies at once
4. Note the timestamp and author for each post
</Step>

<Step title="Filter and Sort Posts">
1. Use the filter dropdown to show **Unread**, **Flagged**, or **All** posts
2. Sort by date, author, or number of replies
3. Use the search bar to find specific content within the discussion
</Step>
</Steps>

### Using the Assess Topic View

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Assessment View">
1. Click the dropdown arrow next to your discussion topic
2. Select **Assess Topic**
3. You will see a list of all students enrolled in the course
</Step>

<Step title="Review Individual Student Contributions">
1. Click on a student's name or the **Topic Score** link
2. View all posts and replies made by that student
3. The panel displays post content, timestamps, and any existing scores
</Step>
</Steps>

## Topic Score vs Individual Post Scoring

Brightspace offers two distinct approaches to grading discussions. Understanding the difference helps you choose the right method for your course.

### Topic Score Grading

With topic scoring, you assign a single overall grade for all of a student's participation in the discussion topic.

**When to use Topic Scoring:**
- You want to assess overall engagement and contribution quality
- Grading individual posts would be too time-consuming
- The discussion is informal or low-stakes
- You are evaluating participation holistically

**How it works:**
1. Review all of a student's posts in the topic
2. Assign one grade based on their total contribution
3. The single score transfers to the Gradebook

### Individual Post Scoring

With individual post scoring, you grade each post separately and Brightspace calculates a final score using your chosen method.

**When to use Individual Post Scoring:**
- You want to reward quality over quantity
- Each post has specific requirements or prompts
- You need granular feedback on individual contributions
- The calculation method aligns with your grading philosophy

**How it works:**
1. Enable **Allow assessment of individual posts** in topic settings
2. Grade each post as students submit them
3. Brightspace automatically calculates the final grade based on your chosen method (average, sum, maximum, etc.)

<Callout type="warning" title="Choose Before Students Post">
Once students have started posting and you have begun grading, changing between topic and individual post scoring can create confusion. Set your grading approach before the discussion opens.
</Callout>

## Using Rubrics for Discussion Grading

Rubrics provide consistent, transparent criteria for assessing discussions.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create or Select a Rubric">
1. Navigate to **Assessment** > **Rubrics** in your course
2. Create a new rubric with criteria relevant to discussion quality:
   - Content quality and depth
   - Critical thinking and analysis
   - Engagement with peers' posts
   - Grammar and clarity
   - Timeliness of posts
3. Or select an existing rubric to attach to your discussion
</Step>

<Step title="Attach the Rubric to Your Discussion">
1. Edit your discussion topic
2. Go to the **Assessment** tab
3. Click **Add Rubric**
4. Select your rubric from the list
5. Save your changes
</Step>

<Step title="Grade Using the Rubric">
1. Open the assessment panel for a student
2. The interactive rubric appears above the grade and feedback fields
3. Click on the appropriate level for each criterion
4. The overall grade automatically updates based on your selections
5. Add written feedback in the Overall Feedback field
6. Click **Publish** or **Save Draft**
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Rubric Visibility">
Consider making your rubric visible to students before they post. This helps them understand your expectations and typically results in higher-quality contributions.
</Callout>

## Assessing Participation Quality

Beyond just counting posts, effective discussion grading evaluates the quality of student contributions.

### Quality Indicators to Consider

| Indicator | What to Look For |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Depth of Analysis** | Does the student go beyond surface-level responses? |
| **Evidence and Support** | Are claims backed by course materials or research? |
| **Peer Engagement** | Does the student respond meaningfully to classmates? |
| **Critical Thinking** | Does the student question assumptions or offer new perspectives? |
| **Communication** | Is the writing clear, organized, and professional? |
| **Timeliness** | Did the student post early enough to allow peer responses? |

### Common Grading Approaches

**1. Minimum Requirements Model**
- Set clear minimums (e.g., 1 original post + 2 replies per week)
- Students meeting requirements receive full credit
- Simple to manage but may encourage minimal effort

**2. Quality-Based Model**
- Use a rubric to evaluate each contribution
- Higher-quality posts receive more points
- More time-intensive but rewards excellence

**3. Participation Points Model**
- Award points for various activities (posting, replying, asking questions)
- Students accumulate points over time
- Encourages ongoing engagement

**4. Peer Evaluation Model**
- Students rate each other's contributions
- Instructor grades include peer feedback
- Builds community but requires careful facilitation

## Providing Feedback on Posts

Meaningful feedback helps students improve their discussion skills.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Feedback Panel">
1. From **Assess Topic**, click on a student's name
2. Or from the Gradebook, click the discussion icon for a student
3. The evaluation panel opens with space for grades and feedback
</Step>

<Step title="Write Constructive Feedback">
1. Use the **Overall Feedback** field for comprehensive comments
2. Reference specific posts when giving feedback
3. Balance positive observations with suggestions for improvement
4. Be specific about what made certain posts strong or weak
</Step>

<Step title="Use Bulk Feedback for Common Comments">
1. From the Assess Topic view, select multiple students
2. Click **Add Feedback** or **Add Feedback to All**
3. Enter feedback that applies to the whole group
4. Individual feedback can still be added separately
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Feedback Best Practices">
Providing feedback mid-discussion (not just at the end) helps students improve their subsequent posts. Consider giving formative feedback after initial posts but before replies are due.
</Callout>

## Publishing Discussion Grades

After grading, you control when students see their grades and feedback.

<Steps>
<Step title="Review Your Grades">
1. From Assess Topic, review the Status column
2. **Draft** indicates grades not yet visible to students
3. **Published** indicates grades students can see
4. Verify all grades are accurate before publishing
</Step>

<Step title="Publish Individual Grades">
1. Click on a student's assessment
2. Review the grade and feedback
3. Click **Publish** to make it visible immediately
</Step>

<Step title="Publish All Grades at Once">
1. From the Assess Topic view, click **Publish All Feedback**
2. Or select specific students and click **Publish Feedback**
3. All selected grades become visible simultaneously
</Step>

<Step title="Retract Grades if Needed">
1. If you need to make changes after publishing, select the student
2. Click **Retract Feedback**
3. The grade becomes a draft again and is hidden from the student
4. Make your changes and republish
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Students Are Notified">
When you publish grades, students may receive notifications depending on their settings. Coordinate timing with any announcements you want to make about discussion performance.
</Callout>

## Grade Transfer to Gradebook

Grades from discussions automatically sync with your Gradebook when properly configured.

### Automatic Synchronization

- Grades published in Discussions appear in the linked grade item
- Changes made in either location sync to the other
- The Gradebook shows the most recently published score

### Grading from the Gradebook

You can also grade discussions directly from the Gradebook:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Discussion Grades in Gradebook">
1. Navigate to **Progress** > **Grades** > **Enter Grades**
2. Find the column for your discussion grade item
3. Look for the chat/discussion icon in the Submission column
</Step>

<Step title="Grade from Gradebook">
1. Click the discussion icon for a student
2. The evaluation panel opens showing their posts
3. Review contributions, add scores and feedback
4. Click **Publish** to save and sync
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Eval Integration">
Use **Progress** > **Quick Eval** to see all ungraded discussion submissions alongside assignments and quizzes. This provides a unified view of pending evaluations across your course.
</Callout>

## Discussion Statistics and Analytics

Brightspace provides built-in statistics to help track participation patterns.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Discussion Statistics">
1. Navigate to **Tools** > **Discussions**

The overview shows aggregate data:
- Total number of threads across all forums
- Total number of replies in the course
- Activity trends over time
</Step>

<Step title="Review User Statistics">
Individual student data includes:
- Number of threads created
- Number of replies made
- Number of posts read
- Number of votes received (if voting is enabled)

This data can inform participation grades and identify students who may need encouragement.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Using Statistics for Grading

| Statistic | How to Use It |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Threads Created** | Verify students posted original contributions |
| **Replies Made** | Check engagement with peer posts |
| **Posts Read** | Identify students who read but do not participate |
| **Vote Count** | See which contributions peers found valuable |

<Callout type="info" title="Limitations">
Brightspace statistics show user-level data but do not provide post-specific analytics (e.g., how many students read a particular post). For more detailed analytics, consider third-party discussion tools that integrate with Brightspace.
