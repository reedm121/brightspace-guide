# Creating and Managing Announcements

## Overview

Announcements are a primary communication tool in Brightspace that allow you to post important updates, reminders, and course-related information prominently on your course homepage. They are ideal for class-wide messages such as welcoming students, notifying them of deadlines, or sharing important course updates.

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical: Student Email Notifications">
Students do NOT automatically receive email notifications for announcements. Email delivery depends entirely on each student's individual notification settings in Brightspace. Many students never configure these settings, so they may only see announcements when they log into Brightspace. Consider reminding students to enable announcement notifications at the start of your course.

## Before You Begin

- You must have **Instructor** or **TA** permissions in the course
- Announcements appear on the Course Home page in the Announcements widget
- The announcement body supports up to 1.5 million characters

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Availability Settings

**Start Date:**
- By default, announcements are set to publish immediately ("Now")
- To schedule for later, uncheck "Now" and set a specific date and time

</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Set Release Conditions (Optional)

Release conditions allow you to show announcements only to specific students:

1. Click **Add Release Conditions**
2. Choose to **Create** a new condition or **Attach Existing**
3. Configure conditions such as:
   - Group or section membership
   - Completion of specific content

<Step>
### Publish or Save as Draft

- Click **Publish** to make the announcement live immediately (or at the scheduled start date)
- Click **Save as Draft** to save without publishing
- Click **Cancel** to discard your changes
</Step>
</Steps>

## Scheduling Announcements

Scheduling allows you to prepare announcements in advance and have them appear automatically at a specific time.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Set a Future Start Date

1. In the **Start Date** section, uncheck the "Now" checkbox
2. Click the date field and select your desired date

</Step>

<Step>
### Set an End Date (Optional)

2. Select the date when the announcement should be hidden
3. Set the time for removal

<Callout type="warning" title="Course Date Restrictions">
If your course has a start date in the future or an end date in the past, creating an announcement will NOT trigger any notifications in Brightspace. Announcements must be created while the course is active to generate notifications.
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Global vs. Course Announcements

Brightspace supports two types of announcements:

| Type | Who Creates | Who Sees | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Course Announcements** | Instructors | Students enrolled in that specific course | Course updates, assignment reminders, schedule changes |
| **Global Announcements** | Administrators | All users in the organization | System maintenance, institution-wide policies, campus alerts |

<Callout type="info" title="Instructor Access">
As an instructor, you can only create course announcements. Global announcements are managed by your institution's Brightspace administrators and may appear on your course homepage if configured to display in course offerings.
</Callout>

## Pinning Important Announcements

To keep critical announcements visible at the top of the list:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Pin an Announcement

1. Go to the **Announcements** tool
2. Click the dropdown menu (three dots or arrow) next to the announcement title
3. Select **Pin to top**

The announcement will now remain at the top of the list regardless of its date.
</Step>

<Step>
### Unpin an Announcement

1. Click the dropdown menu next to the pinned announcement
2. Select **Unpin**

The announcement will return to its chronological position.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Editing and Deleting Announcements

### Editing an Announcement

<Steps>
<Step>
1. Navigate to the **Announcements** tool
2. Click the dropdown menu next to the announcement
3. Select **Edit**
4. Make your changes
5. Click **Publish** or **Save as Draft**
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Author Display Options">
When creating or editing an announcement, you can choose to display author information and edit timestamps to students.
</Callout>

### Deleting an Announcement

<Steps>
<Step>
1. Navigate to the **Announcements** tool
2. Click the dropdown menu next to the announcement
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm the deletion
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Restore Deleted Announcements">
Deleted announcements can be restored. Access **More Actions** in the Announcements tool to find the restore option.
</Callout>

### Dismissing vs. Deleting

- **Dismissing**: Clicking the X on an announcement hides it only for YOUR view. Other users (including students) will still see it. This is useful for clearing announcements from your personal homepage.
- **Deleting**: Permanently removes the announcement for everyone (though it can be restored).

## Copying Announcements to Other Courses

You can copy announcements to multiple courses:

<Steps>
<Step>
1. In the Announcements tool, click the dropdown next to the announcement
2. Select **Copy to Other Courses**
3. Choose up to 10 courses where you have announcement permissions
4. Click **Copy**
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Copy Limitations">
- Copied announcements appear as **drafts** in the destination courses
- Release conditions do NOT transfer with copied announcements
- You must publish copied announcements manually in each course
</Callout>

## Student Notification Settings

Understanding how students receive announcement notifications is critical for effective communication.

### How Students See Announcements

Students can view announcements through:

1. **Brightspace Homepage**: In the Announcements widget on their main Brightspace landing page
2. **Course Homepage**: In the Announcements widget on individual course pages
3. **Update Alerts**: Via the notification bell icon (Minibar) at the top of Brightspace
4. **Email**: Only if they have enabled email notifications
5. **Pulse App**: Push notifications if using the Brightspace mobile app

### Default Notification Behavior

<Callout type="error" title="Important">
By default, many students do NOT have email notifications enabled for announcements. This means:
- Students may not see your announcement until they log into Brightspace
- Urgent communications may be missed
- You cannot force email delivery of announcements
</Callout>

### Encouraging Students to Enable Notifications

At the start of your course, consider:

1. Posting instructions for enabling notifications
2. Demonstrating the notification settings in class
3. Explaining the importance of timely communication

**Student steps to enable notifications:**
1. Click their profile icon (top-right corner)
2. Select **Notifications**
3. Under **Instant Notifications**, enable email or SMS for Announcements
4. Save settings

## Display Options

### Announcements Widget

The standard Announcements widget displays announcements with:
- Full headline
- Content preview
- Date posted
- Ability to expand and read full content

### Slim Announcements Widget

A compact alternative that:
- Shows only announcement headlines
- Takes up less space on the homepage
- Requires clicking to read content

<Callout type="tip" title="Widget Selection">
You can enable the Slim Announcements widget through your course homepage settings if you prefer a more compact display.
</Callout>

## Best Practices for Announcements

### Keep Announcements Focused

- Limit to 3-5 visible announcements on your course homepage
- Students tend to ignore or skim past long lists of announcements
- Archive or remove outdated announcements regularly

### Write Clear Headlines

- Use descriptive, action-oriented headlines
- Include dates for time-sensitive announcements
- Examples: "Assignment 3 Due Friday 10/15" or "Class Canceled - November 5"

### Use Announcements Appropriately

| Use Announcements For | Use Other Tools For |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Class-wide updates | Individual student communication (Email) |
| Schedule changes | Confidential information (Email) |
| Assignment reminders | Ongoing discussions (Discussion Forums) |
| Course news | Detailed instructions (Content modules) |
| Welcome messages | Grade notifications (Gradebook) |

### Timing Considerations

- Post announcements during times students are likely to check Brightspace
- For urgent announcements, consider supplementing with email
- Use scheduling to prepare weekly announcements in advance

### Supplement Critical Communications

Since you cannot guarantee students will see announcements:
- For truly urgent matters, also send a direct email via Brightspace Email or Classlist
- Mention important announcements verbally in class
- Use multiple channels for critical deadlines

## Common Issues

### Announcement Not Appearing

- Check the start date - it may be set for the future
- Verify the course dates - announcements won't display if the course is inactive
- Check release conditions - the announcement may be restricted

### Students Didn't Receive Notification

- Remind students to enable announcement notifications
- Check if the course was active when the announcement was created
- Consider using email for critical communications

### Cannot Find Deleted Announcement

- Go to the Announcements tool
- Click **More Actions**
- Look for restore or deleted items option
