# Calendar Integration

## Overview

The Calendar tool in Brightspace is a centralized hub where you and your students can view all upcoming course events and deadlines in one location. It automatically displays due dates from assignments, quizzes, and discussions, while also allowing you to manually create events like office hours, class sessions, and important reminders.

<Callout type="info" title="Automatic Due Date Display">
When you set a due date on any assignment, quiz, discussion, or other activity in Brightspace, that date automatically appears on the course calendar. Students see these deadlines without any additional configuration from you.
</Callout>

## Before You Begin

- You must have **Instructor** or appropriate permissions to create and manage course calendar events
- The Calendar tool must be enabled in your course navbar (contact your administrator if unavailable)
- Calendar permissions are set by your institution's Brightspace administrator

## Accessing the Course Calendar

There are multiple ways to access the calendar in Brightspace:

<Steps>
<Step>
### From the Course Homepage

1. Navigate to your course homepage
2. Locate the **Calendar** widget (displays upcoming events)
3. Click the dropdown arrow next to "Calendar"
4. Select **Go to Calendar** to open the full calendar view
</Step>

<Step>
### From the Navbar

If your course has Calendar in the navbar:

1. Click **Tools** or **Communication** in the course navbar
2. Select **Calendar** from the dropdown menu
3. The full calendar interface will open
</Step>

<Step>
### From the Minibar (Global Calendar)

1. Click the **Calendar** icon in the Brightspace minibar (top navigation)
2. This displays events from all your courses
3. Use the calendar dropdown to filter by specific course
</Step>
</Steps>

## Calendar Views

Brightspace offers multiple ways to view your calendar:

| View | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Agenda** | Groups events chronologically by date, course, or category | Quick overview of upcoming items |
| **Day** | Shows all events for a single day | Detailed daily planning |

*The Calendar tool showing the month view with events and due dates.*

### List View Filters

The List view allows you to filter events by type:
- Assignments (Dropbox)
- Checklists
- Discussions
- Grades
- Materials
- Modules
- Quizzes
- Surveys

<Callout type="tip" title="View Navigation">
Use the mini calendar on the left side of the Calendar page to quickly jump to specific dates. Click any date to navigate directly to that day's events.
</Callout>

## How Due Dates Appear Automatically

One of the most powerful features of the Brightspace calendar is automatic due date population. When you create activities with due dates, they automatically appear on the calendar.

### What Appears Automatically

| Activity Type | When It Appears |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Assignments** | When a due date is set in the assignment settings |
| **Quizzes** | When a due date is configured in quiz availability |
| **Discussions** | When a due date is assigned to a discussion topic |
| **Checklists** | When checklist items have due dates |
| **Surveys** | When survey due dates are set |

<Callout type="warning" title="Due Date vs. End Date">
**Due Date** is a "soft" deadline that appears on the calendar but does NOT prevent late submissions. Students can still submit after the due date.

**End Date** closes access completely but does NOT appear on the calendar. If you use end dates, communicate them clearly to students through other means.
</Callout>

### Where Students See Due Dates

Students can view their due dates in multiple locations:
1. **Course Calendar** - The calendar widget on the course homepage
2. **Global Calendar** - All courses combined via the minibar
3. **Work To Do Widget** - Upcoming assignments on their homepage
4. **Pulse Mobile App** - Push notifications and calendar view
5. **Synced External Calendars** - If they subscribe via iCal

## Creating Calendar Events Manually

While due dates appear automatically, you will need to manually create events for items like office hours, class sessions, guest speakers, and other course activities.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Access the Create Event Page

1. Navigate to the **Calendar** tool in your course
2. Ensure the correct course is selected in the calendar dropdown
3. Click the **Create Event** button
</Step>

<Step>
### Add Content Association (Optional)

If you want to link the event to specific course content:

1. Click **Add Content**
2. Browse to select a module, submodule, or specific content item
3. Use the arrow icon to navigate into modules
4. Select the item using the radio button
5. Click **Add**

<Callout type="info" title="Auto-Naming">
When you associate content, the event name will automatically use the content title. Check "Use custom name" if you want to override this with your own title.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Enter Event Details

Complete the following fields:

- **Event Name**: Clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Office Hours - Week 3" or "Midterm Review Session")
- **Description**: Optional details about the event, including any preparation needed
- **When**: Click the date and time fields to set:
  - Start date and time
  - End date and time (or check "All Day" for full-day events)
</Step>

<Step>
### Set Location (Optional)

1. Click the **Location** dropdown
2. Select from existing locations, or
3. Enter a custom location (e.g., "Room 205" or "Zoom - link in announcements")

<Callout type="tip" title="Virtual Locations">
For online events, include meeting links or instructions on how to join in the description field, as the location field has character limits.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Attendees

In the **Attendees** section:

1. By default, the event is visible to all course participants
2. To limit visibility, click **Add Groups/Sections**
3. Select specific groups or sections who should see the event
4. You can customize date, time, and location for each group
</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Event

1. Review all event details
2. Click **Create** to save the event
3. The event will appear on the Calendar page and homepage widget
</Step>
</Steps>

## Event Visibility Settings

Brightspace provides flexible visibility controls for calendar events, allowing you to show or hide events at specific times.

### Changing Event Visibility

<Steps>
<Step>
### Access Visibility Settings

1. Go to the **Calendar** tool
2. Switch to the **List** view for easier management
3. Select one or more events using the checkboxes
4. Click **More Actions**
5. Select **Change Event Visibility**
</Step>

<Step>
### Choose Visibility Option

Select from the following options:

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Visible** | Event is always visible to students |
| **Hidden** | Event is completely hidden from students |
| **Hidden Until** | Event becomes visible a specified time before it starts |
| **Hidden After** | Event is hidden a specified time after it starts |
| **Visible Between** | Event is only visible during a specific date range |
</Step>

<Step>
### Save Changes

Click **Save** to apply the visibility settings to the selected events.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Use Case: Hidden Until">
"Hidden Until" is useful for events that should only appear as they approach. For example, setting "Hidden Until: 7 days before start" reveals office hours one week in advance.
</Callout>

### Adding Restrictions to Events

When creating an event, you can add restrictions based on release conditions:

1. Click **Add Restriction** in the event creation form
2. Select conditions such as:
   - Group membership
   - Content completion
   - Date/time windows
3. Only students meeting the conditions will see the event

## Recurring Events

For events that repeat regularly (like weekly office hours or class sessions), use the recurrence feature instead of creating each event individually.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create the First Instance

1. Start creating a new event as described above
2. Enter all the basic details (name, description, time, location)
</Step>

<Step>
### Add Recurrence Pattern

1. Click **Add Recurrence**
2. In the **Recurrence** dropdown, select the pattern:
   - Daily
   - Weekly
   - Monthly
   - Yearly
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Weekly Recurrence (Most Common)

For weekly recurring events:

1. Select **Weekly** from the Recurrence dropdown
2. Set "Repeat every: **1** week" (or 2 for bi-weekly)
3. Check the days of the week the event occurs
4. Set the **Series End** date (align with course end date)
</Step>

<Step>
### Handle Multiple Days Per Week

If your event occurs on different days with different times (e.g., Monday 10am and Wednesday 2pm):

1. Create the Monday recurrence first
2. Create a separate recurring event for Wednesday
3. This allows different times for each day
</Step>

<Step>
### Save the Recurring Series

Click **Create** to generate all instances of the recurring event.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Do Not Import Recurring Events">
If you have recurring events in an external calendar, do NOT import them into Brightspace. Imported recurring events become individual events, requiring manual edits to each instance if changes are needed. Always create recurring events directly in Brightspace.
</Callout>

## Calendar Subscriptions (iCal Export)

Both instructors and students can subscribe to Brightspace calendars using iCal feeds, which sync events to external calendar applications like Google Calendar, Outlook, or Apple Calendar.

### Enabling Calendar Feeds

<Steps>
<Step>
### Access Calendar Settings

1. Navigate to the **Calendar** tool
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon or Settings link)
3. Check the box for **Enable Calendar Feeds**
4. Click **Save**
</Step>

<Step>
### Get Your Subscription URL

3. From the dropdown, select:
   - A specific course calendar
   - All Calendars and Tasks
   - Tasks Only
4. Copy the provided URL (this is your private feed link)
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="error" title="Keep Your Feed URL Private">
The calendar feed URL is unique to you and provides access to your calendar data. Do not share this URL publicly. If compromised, you can regenerate it in Settings.
</Callout>

### Syncing with External Calendars

#### Google Calendar

<Steps>
<Step>
1. Open **Google Calendar** in your browser
2. Click the **+** next to "Other calendars" in the left sidebar
3. Select **From URL**
4. Paste your Brightspace calendar feed URL
5. Click **Add calendar**
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Google Calendar Sync Delay">
Google Calendar may take up to 12 hours to reflect changes from Brightspace. This is a Google limitation, not a Brightspace issue.
</Callout>

#### Microsoft Outlook

<Steps>
<Step>

2. Go to **Calendar Settings** or **Add Calendar**
3. Select **Subscribe from Web** or **From Internet**

</Step>
</Steps>

### Subscribe vs. Download

| Method | Behavior | Updates |

| **Download (.ics)** | Creates a one-time snapshot | No updates - static copy |

<Callout type="tip" title="Always Subscribe">
For ongoing courses, always use the Subscribe option with the URL. Downloaded .ics files are only useful for archiving past events.
</Callout>

## Importing Events into Brightspace

You can import events from external calendars into Brightspace using iCal (.ics) files.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Export from Your External Calendar

1. In your external calendar (Google, Outlook, etc.), export events as an **.ics** file
2. Save the file to your computer
</Step>

<Step>
### Import into Brightspace

1. Navigate to the **Calendar** tool in your course
2. Click **Import** (may be under More Actions)
3. Select the target calendar (your course)
4. Choose your **Attendees** (who will see imported events)
5. Upload the .ics file
6. Click **Import**
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Import Limitations">
- Imported events are NOT synced - changes in the original calendar won't reflect in Brightspace
- Recurring events import as individual instances (avoid importing recurring events)
- Always review imported events for accuracy
</Callout>

## Student Calendar View

Understanding how students interact with the calendar helps you design a better course experience.

### What Students See

Students can access the calendar through:
1. **Course Homepage Widget** - Shows upcoming events for that course
2. **Global Calendar** - Combines events from all enrolled courses
3. **Pulse Mobile App** - Mobile-friendly calendar with push notifications
4. **Subscribed External Calendars** - If they've set up iCal feeds

### Student Actions

Students can:
- View all upcoming due dates and events
- Filter by course or activity type
- Subscribe to calendars via iCal
- Create personal tasks (only visible to themselves)
- Adjust calendar settings and preferences

<Callout type="info" title="Students Cannot Edit Course Events">
Students can only view events you create - they cannot edit or delete course events. They can create personal tasks that only they can see.
</Callout>

### Work To Do Widget

Many students rely on the **Work To Do** widget on their homepage, which displays:
- Upcoming assignment due dates
- Quiz deadlines
- Discussion due dates
- Other activities with due dates

This widget pulls from the same data as the calendar, providing another view of deadlines.

## Managing Dates in Bulk

For courses with many dated activities, Brightspace offers bulk date management.

### Offset Dates Feature

If you need to shift all dates forward or backward (common when copying courses):

<Steps>
<Step>
1. Navigate to **Calendar** and switch to **List** view
2. Select the events you want to adjust
3. Click **More Actions** > **Offset Dates**
4. Choose direction: Forward or Backward
5. Enter the number of days, hours, or minutes
6. Click **Apply**
</Step>
</Steps>

### Manage Dates Tool

For comprehensive date management across all course activities:

![Manage Dates Tool](/images/docs/course-setup/manage-dates.png)
*The Manage Dates tool showing all course activities with their start, due, and end dates in one view.*

2. Select **Manage Dates**
3. View and edit dates for:

When copying a course to a new term, use Manage Dates to offset all dates by the number of days between the old and new term start dates.
</Callout>

## Calendar Widget on Homepage

The Calendar widget provides a quick overview of upcoming events directly on your course homepage.

### Configuring the Widget

1. Go to your course homepage
2. If in edit mode, you can add or configure widgets
3. The Calendar widget typically shows:
   - Upcoming events (next 7-14 days)
   - Mini calendar for date navigation
   - Quick links to create events or view full calendar

### Widget Display Options

Depending on your institution's configuration, you may have options for:
- Number of upcoming events to display

- Event types to include
- Widget size and position

## Calendar Settings

Access calendar settings to customize your experience:

<Steps>
<Step>

   - **Core Hours**: Set your typical working hours (affects display)
   - **Default Event Duration**: Set standard length for new events
   - **Task Display**: Show/hide personal tasks
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Calendar Management

### Set Due Dates Consistently

- Use due dates for all assignments, quizzes, and discussions
- Set times that work for your students (avoid midnight deadlines if possible)
- Consider time zones if you have remote students

### Create Events for Key Sessions

- Add recurring events for regular class sessions
- Create events for office hours with location/Zoom details
- Post exam dates and review sessions well in advance

### Communicate Calendar Usage to Students

At the start of your course:
1. Show students how to access the calendar
2. Encourage them to subscribe via iCal
3. Explain the difference between due dates and end dates
4. Recommend enabling notifications in the Pulse app

### Keep the Calendar Updated

- Update events if times or locations change
- Delete or hide events that are no longer relevant
- Review the calendar regularly from a student's perspective

### Use Groups/Sections Wisely

- Create section-specific events for different class times
- Use group restrictions for events relevant only to certain students
- Customize locations for each section when meeting in different rooms

<Callout type="tip" title="Student Perspective Check">
Periodically use the "View as Student" feature (if available) or ask a student to show you their calendar view. This helps ensure your events and due dates display correctly.
</Callout>

## Common Issues

### Event Not Appearing on Calendar

- Check the event's visibility settings - it may be hidden
- Verify the event dates are correct and not in the past
- Ensure the calendar shows the correct date range
- Check if release conditions are restricting visibility

### Students Report Missing Due Dates

- Confirm you set a **due date** (not just an end date)
- End dates do not appear on calendars
- Ask students to refresh their synced calendars
- Check that activities are not hidden or restricted

### Synced Calendar Not Updating

- Google Calendar can take up to 12 hours to sync
- Outlook and other apps have varying refresh intervals
- Students can manually refresh by removing and re-subscribing
- Verify the feed URL is still valid in Brightspace settings

### Recurring Events Not Displaying Correctly

- Ensure recurrence pattern is set correctly
- Check that series end date covers all desired dates
- Verify the correct days are selected for weekly events
