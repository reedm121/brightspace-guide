# Understanding Notification Limitations

## Overview

Brightspace offers multiple notification channels to help students stay informed about course activity. However, understanding the limitations and default settings is critical for effective communication. Many instructors are surprised to discover that students often do not receive their messages because notification settings may be disabled by default or configured incorrectly.

This guide explains how Brightspace notifications work, their limitations, and strategies for ensuring students receive your communications.

<Callout type="error" title="Critical: Notifications Are Often Off By Default">
Many students have email notifications disabled by default. This means students may only see announcements, grade updates, and other communications when they actively log into Brightspace. You cannot force students to enable notifications, so always have a backup communication strategy for critical information.
</Callout>

## How Brightspace Notifications Work

Brightspace has three main notification channels:

| Channel | Description | Student Control |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **In-App Alerts** | Notification bell icon (minibar) shows updates when logged in | Cannot be disabled |
| **Email Notifications** | Emails sent to student's registered address | Fully customizable by student |
| **Push Notifications** | Alerts via Brightspace Pulse mobile app | Configurable in app settings |

### In-App Notifications (Update Alerts)

The notification bell icon in the top-right corner of Brightspace (also called the minibar) shows updates about:

- New announcements
- Upcoming deadlines
- Grade releases
- Discussion replies
- Content changes

An orange dot on the bell indicates new unread notifications.

<Callout type="info" title="Update Alerts Are System-Generated">
In-app update alerts cannot be customized or disabled by users. They are pre-defined by the system and automatically disappear after 7 days. This is different from email notifications, which students can fully control.
</Callout>

### Email Notifications

Email notifications are triggered by course activity and sent to students' registered email addresses. Students have full control over which email notifications they receive.

**Default Email Notifications** (may vary by institution):
- Announcements (new and updated)
- Assignments (due date reminders, typically 2 days before)
- Quizzes (due date reminders)
- Discussions (new posts in subscribed forums/topics only)

<Callout type="warning" title="Default Settings May Not Be Enabled">
If a student's account was created before your institution implemented notification defaults, they may not have any email notifications enabled. Always remind students to check their settings.
</Callout>

### Push Notifications (Pulse App)

The Brightspace Pulse mobile app can send push notifications directly to students' phones. This is often the most reliable way for students to receive timely updates.

Pulse notifications include:
- New announcements
- Assignment and quiz due dates
- Grade releases
- Content updates
- Discussion activity

## Types of Notifications Available

### Instant Notifications

Instant notifications are sent immediately when an event occurs. Students can enable instant notifications for:

| Category | Notification Type |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Announcements** | New announcement posted, announcement updated |
| **Content** | New content available, content updated |
| **Assignments** | Due date approaching, submission received |
| **Quizzes** | Due date approaching, attempt graded |
| **Discussions** | New post in subscribed forum/topic/thread |
| **Grades** | New grade available, grade updated |
| **Feedback** | New feedback received |

### Summary Notifications (Digest)

Instead of receiving individual emails, students can opt for a daily or weekly summary of all course activity.

**Summary Options:**
- **Never**: No summary emails (default for many users)
- **Daily**: One email per day with all activity
- **Weekly**: One email per week with all activity

Students can also set the specific day and time to receive summary emails.

<Callout type="tip" title="Recommend Instant for Important Items">
Encourage students to enable instant notifications for announcements and grades, even if they prefer summaries for other activity. This ensures they receive critical information promptly.
</Callout>

### SMS/Text Notifications

Some institutions enable SMS notifications. Students can register their mobile phone number and receive text messages for selected notifications.

<Callout type="warning" title="SMS Limitations">
SMS notifications may have a daily or weekly limit to prevent excessive messaging. Once the limit is reached, students may miss updates. The default limit is often around 10 messages per period.
</Callout>

## Why Students May Not Receive Notifications

Understanding why notifications fail is essential for troubleshooting communication issues.

### Common Reasons for Missing Notifications

| Reason | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| **Notifications not enabled** | Student must manually enable in settings |
| **Course is inactive** | Course must be within start/end dates |
| **Email spam filtering** | Brightspace emails flagged as spam |
| **Wrong email address** | Student email not updated or incorrect |
| **Course exclusions** | Student excluded the course from notifications |
| **Demo/test account** | Demo accounts don't receive notifications |
| **Future notifications disabled** | "Allow future courses" option not checked |

### Course Date Restrictions

<Callout type="error" title="Course Dates Block Notifications">
Notifications are ONLY sent when the course is active. If your course has:
- A **start date in the future**: No notifications are sent yet
- An **end date in the past**: No notifications are sent anymore

Adjust your course dates in Course Offering Information if you need to send notifications outside the normal term dates.
</Callout>

### Email Filtering Issues

Brightspace notification emails may be filtered as spam by email providers. Students should:

1. Check their spam/junk folder for Brightspace emails
2. Add the Brightspace notification email address to their contacts
3. Mark Brightspace emails as "not spam" if found in spam folder
4. Check their email's blocked senders list

<Callout type="warning" title="Copied Course Warning">

</Step>

<Step>
### Include in Syllabus

Add a note in your syllabus that students are responsible for enabling Brightspace notifications and checking the course regularly.
</Step>

<Step>

## Common Notification Issues

### Issue: Students Say They Never Received Notification

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. Ask the student to check their spam/junk folder
2. Verify the course was active (within start/end dates) when you posted
3. Have the student check their notification settings
4. Confirm they haven't excluded your course from notifications
5. Check if they're using a demo/test account

### Issue: Notifications Delayed

Brightspace notifications may sometimes experience delays. If this occurs:

1. Use multiple communication channels for urgent messages
2. Post important announcements well in advance
3. Contact your IT department if delays are consistent

### Issue: Notifications Going to Spam

If students report Brightspace emails going to spam:

1. Share the Brightspace notification email address to add to contacts
2. Instruct students to mark emails as "not spam"
3. Report the issue to IT if it's widespread

### Issue: Faculty Not Receiving Submission Notifications

Faculty notification options are limited in Brightspace. To receive submission alerts:

1. Add your email in the assignment/quiz notification field
2. Use Intelligent Agents to send automated notifications
3. Check the My Courses widget for submission indicators

### Issue: Notifications Stop After Course End

<Callout type="info" title="Expected Behavior">
This is by design. Notifications only send during active course dates. If you need to communicate after the term ends, adjust the course end date in Course Offering Information or use direct email.
</Callout>

## Best Practices for Communication

Given the limitations of Brightspace notifications, consider these strategies:

### Use Multiple Channels

Never rely solely on Brightspace notifications for critical information:

| Urgency | Communication Strategy |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Routine updates** | Announcement only |
| **Important deadlines** | Announcement + in-class reminder |
| **Urgent/emergency** | Announcement + direct email + verbal |

### Set Clear Expectations

- Explain notification limitations in your syllabus
- Tell students it's their responsibility to check Brightspace regularly
- Specify how often you expect students to log in (e.g., daily, every other day)

### Time Your Communications

- Post announcements during times students are likely to check Brightspace
- Use scheduled announcements to prepare communications in advance
- Avoid posting during holidays or late at night

### Supplement with Other Tools

- Use Intelligent Agents for automated reminders
- Send direct emails via Brightspace Email or Classlist for critical items
- Consider using your institution's email for truly urgent communications
