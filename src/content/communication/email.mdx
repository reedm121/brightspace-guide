# Email Integration

## Overview

Brightspace includes a built-in email tool that allows instructors to communicate directly with students enrolled in their courses. Unlike announcements (which students may or may not receive depending on their notification settings), emails sent through Brightspace are delivered directly to students' institutional email accounts, making it a reliable method for important communications.

<Callout type="info" title="Key Understanding">
Brightspace email is a **send-only** system. Messages sent from Brightspace are delivered to recipients' institutional email accounts (such as Outlook or Gmail provided by your institution). There is no email inbox within Brightspace itself - only a Sent folder that stores copies of messages you have sent.
</Callout>

## Before You Begin

- You must have **Instructor**, **TA**, or appropriate permissions in the course
- Students must be enrolled in your course to receive emails
- Emails are sent to students' institutional email addresses (not personal emails)
- Recipients cannot reply directly to Brightspace emails from their external email client - they must log into Brightspace to respond

### Understanding Delivery

<Callout type="warning" title="No Read Receipts">
Brightspace does not provide read receipts or delivery confirmation for emails. Once you send an email, it is delivered to recipients' institutional email accounts, but you cannot verify if they have opened or read the message.
</Callout>

### Delivery Timing

- Emails are typically delivered within minutes of sending
- Delivery depends on your institution's email server
- Some institutions may have email queuing that affects delivery time
- Emails sent outside of course active dates (before start date or after end date) may still be delivered, but this depends on your institution's configuration

## Student Email Preferences and Notifications

### How Students Receive Emails

When you send an email through Brightspace:

1. The message is delivered to the student's **institutional email account** (e.g., their university Gmail or Outlook)
2. Students do NOT receive the email within Brightspace itself
3. If students have set up **email forwarding** in Brightspace, copies may also go to their personal email

### Understanding Student Notification Settings

<Callout type="info" title="Student Control">
Students control their own notification preferences in Brightspace. They can choose to receive email notifications for various course activities (announcements, grades, discussions, etc.) through their notification settings.
</Callout>

Students can configure notifications by:

1. Clicking their **profile icon** (top-right corner)
2. Selecting **Notifications**
3. Choosing which activities trigger email notifications
4. Setting up **Summary of Activity** (daily or weekly digests)
5. Optionally **excluding specific courses** from notifications

### Email vs. Announcements

| Feature | Email | Announcements |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **Delivery** | Sent directly to institutional email | Students may or may not get email notification |
| **Reliability** | More reliable for urgent messages | Depends on student notification settings |
| **Privacy** | Recipients in BCC by default | Visible to all course users |
| **Record** | Stored in Sent folder | Stored on course homepage |
| **Use Case** | Individual/private communication | Class-wide public updates |

## Configuring Your Email Settings

### Setting Up Email Forwarding

As an instructor, you can configure where you receive copies of Brightspace emails:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Access Email Settings

Click on your **profile icon** in the top-right corner, then select **Account Settings** or **Email**.
</Step>

<Step>
### Find Forwarding Options

Look for **Forwarding Options** or **Email Settings** section.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Forwarding

You can set up forwarding to an external email address if you prefer to receive Brightspace emails in a different inbox.

<Callout type="warning" title="Reply Limitation">
Even if emails are forwarded to an external account, you CANNOT reply from that external account. Replies must be sent from within Brightspace.
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Using Custom Email Addresses

Some institutions allow you to specify a custom email address for Brightspace communications:

1. Go to **Notifications** in your account settings
2. Click **Change your email settings**
3. Select **Use custom email**
4. Enter your preferred email address
5. Click **Save**

## Common Email Issues

### Emails Not Being Received

<Callout type="error" title="Troubleshooting Steps">
If students report not receiving your emails:

1. **Verify the recipient's email address** - Check if there are typos in their institutional email
2. **Check spam/junk folders** - Brightspace emails may be filtered
3. **Confirm enrollment** - Students must be enrolled in the course to receive course emails
4. **Verify email filters** - If students have email filters set to anything other than "All Messages," some emails may be hidden
5. **Check course dates** - Some institutions restrict email during inactive course periods
</Callout>

### Undelivered Email Notifications

If you receive an "undelivered email" notification:

- **Check the recipient's email address** for typos (e.g., "gmial" instead of "gmail")
- **Contact IT support** - The recipient may have an invalid or malformed email address in the system
- **Verify forwarding settings** - Malformed addresses in forwarding options cause delivery failures

### Cannot Reply from External Email

<Callout type="info" title="Closed Email System">
Brightspace email is a **closed system**. This means:
- You can only send emails to other Brightspace users
- Recipients cannot reply from their external email client (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- All replies must be made by logging into Brightspace

Example: If a student receives your email in their Gmail and tries to reply from Gmail, the reply will fail. They must log into Brightspace to respond.
</Callout>

### "No Internal Permission" Error

If you see a "No Internal Permission" error when trying to send email:

1. Contact your institution's IT or Brightspace administrator
2. You may need additional permissions assigned to your role
3. This is typically a configuration issue that requires admin intervention

### Student Email Address Issues

Common problems with student email addresses:

- **Typos in Banner/SIS data** - Errors in the student information system carry over to Brightspace
- **Custom email misconfiguration** - Students may have entered incorrect addresses in their custom email settings
- **Outdated email addresses** - Email addresses may not update properly after changes

## Privacy Considerations

### FERPA Compliance

<Callout type="warning" title="FERPA Requirements">
When sending emails through Brightspace, be mindful of FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) regulations:

- **Never share student email addresses** with external entities without written consent
- **Do not send protected information** (grades, attendance records, etc.) to personal email accounts
- **Use BCC for group emails** (Brightspace does this automatically) to protect student privacy
- **Do not forward student information** outside of university-approved systems
</Callout>

### Why BCC is Used by Default

When emailing multiple students through Brightspace, their addresses are automatically placed in the **BCC (Blind Carbon Copy)** field. This:

- Prevents students from seeing each other's email addresses
- Protects student privacy
- Complies with data protection requirements

### Best Practices for Email Privacy

1. **Use Brightspace email for course-related communication** rather than personal email accounts
2. **Avoid including sensitive information** like grades in email subject lines
3. **Never share class rosters** or student email lists outside of Brightspace
4. **Be cautious with attachments** - ensure they don't contain other students' information
5. **Use announcements for public information** and email for private/individual matters

### Data Protection

D2L (the company behind Brightspace) acts as a "school official" under FERPA when handling student data. This means:

- Student data in Brightspace is protected under FERPA regulations
- D2L cannot use student data for purposes other than providing the service
- Your institution maintains control over how student data is used

## Best Practices for Course Email

### When to Use Email vs. Other Tools

| Situation | Recommended Tool |
|-----------|------------------|
| Class-wide public updates | Announcements |
| Individual student concerns | Email |
| Confidential information | Email |
| Grade discussions | Email or Gradebook feedback |
| Assignment reminders | Announcements or Intelligent Agents |
| Group-specific updates | Email (filtered by group) or Group Discussions |

### Writing Effective Course Emails

1. **Use clear, descriptive subject lines** - Include course name/code and topic
2. **Be concise** - Get to the point quickly
3. **Include deadlines prominently** - Bold or highlight important dates
4. **Provide next steps** - Tell students what action to take
5. **Sign with your name and course** - Help students identify the sender

### Email Etiquette Tips

- **Respond promptly** to student emails (within 24-48 hours during the week)
- **Set expectations** about response times in your syllabus
- **Use a professional tone** while remaining approachable
- **Proofread before sending** - Emails cannot be recalled
- **Consider timing** - Avoid sending emails late at night or on weekends unless urgent

### Supplementing Email with Other Communication

Since Brightspace email has limitations (no reply from external email, no read receipts), consider:

- Using **announcements** for general updates
- Setting up **Intelligent Agents** for automated reminders
- Holding **virtual office hours** for complex discussions
- Using **Discussion Forums** for questions that benefit the whole class
