# Classlist

## What is the Classlist?

The **Classlist** tool displays everyone enrolled in your course—students, TAs, co-instructors, and other participants. It's your course roster, providing quick access to student information, email addresses, and enrollment details.

While you typically can't add or remove students yourself (enrollment is managed by your institution's registrar system), the Classlist is essential for viewing who's in your course and communicating with them.

## Why Use the Classlist?

The Classlist provides quick access to important student information:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **View Enrollment** | See all students enrolled in your course |
| **Contact Students** | Email individuals or groups directly |
| **Check Sections** | See which section each student belongs to |
| **View Roles** | Identify TAs, auditors, and other special roles |
| **Access Profiles** | View student profile information |
| **Track Activity** | See last login dates and access patterns |

<Callout type="info" title="Enrollment Source">
Students are typically added to your Classlist automatically through your institution's Student Information System (SIS). If a student is missing, contact your registrar or IT department.

## Accessing the Classlist

To view your course Classlist:

1. From your course navbar, click **Classlist** (or **Communication** > **Classlist**)
2. You'll see a table listing all enrolled users

The location may vary depending on your institution's navbar configuration.

| **Role** | Student, TA, Instructor, etc. |
| **Last Accessed** | When they last visited the course |

## What Instructors CAN'T Do

The Classlist is primarily a viewing tool. Most institutions restrict instructors from:

- **Adding students** - Must be done through registrar/SIS
- **Removing students** - Official drops go through registrar
- **Changing roles** - Contact your admin to add TAs
- **Modifying sections** - Section assignment is typically SIS-controlled

<Callout type="warning" title="Adding Late Students">
If a student registered late and isn't appearing in your Classlist, wait 24 hours for the system to sync. If they're still missing, contact your institution's help desk.
</Callout>

## Printing the Classlist

To print your roster:

1. Open the Classlist
2. Click the **Print** icon or use your browser's print function
3. Consider selecting specific columns to print
4. Use "Print Preview" to check the layout

This is useful for taking attendance in face-to-face classes.

## Privacy Considerations

- Student email addresses should only be used for course-related communication
- Don't share the Classlist with people outside the course
- FERPA (in the US) protects student enrollment information
- Use BCC when emailing groups to protect student email privacy

## Best Practices

### Early Semester
- Review your Classlist at the start of the term
- Note any discrepancies between your official roster and Brightspace
- Identify students with accessibility needs or accommodations

### During the Semester
- Check "Last Accessed" to identify disengaged students
- Use email integration for quick communication
- Review section assignments if teaching multiple sections

### Communication Tips
- Use Announcements for class-wide messages instead of Classlist email
- Save Classlist email for individual or small group communication
- Always BCC when emailing groups to protect privacy
