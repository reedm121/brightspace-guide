# Attendance Tracking

## Overview

The **Attendance** tool in Brightspace allows you to track student attendance for face-to-face, hybrid, or synchronous online classes. You can create attendance registers, record attendance for each class session, and export attendance data for reporting purposes.

<Callout type="info" title="Tool Availability">
The Attendance tool may not be enabled at all institutions. If you do not see Attendance in your course, contact your Brightspace administrator to request it be enabled.
</Callout>

## Why Track Attendance?

Attendance tracking serves several purposes:

| Purpose | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Participation Grades** | Include attendance as part of students overall grades |
| **Early Intervention** | Identify students missing class before they fall too far behind |
| **Compliance** | Meet institutional or financial aid attendance requirements |
| **Documentation** | Keep records for academic appeals or grade disputes |
| **Engagement Insights** | Correlate attendance with course performance |

## Accessing Attendance

To access the Attendance tool:

1. From your course navbar, look for **Attendance** (may be under **Tools** or **Course Admin**)
2. If you do not see it in the navbar, go to **Course Admin** and look for **Attendance**
3. Click to open the Attendance Register

<Callout type="tip" title="Add to Navbar">
If you use Attendance frequently, ask your administrator to add it directly to your course navbar for quick access.
</Callout>

## Creating an Attendance Register

Before you can take attendance, you need to create an attendance register (also called an attendance scheme).

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Attendance Settings">
From the Attendance tool, click **Attendance Registers** or **New Register** to create a new register.
</Step>

<Step title="Name Your Register">
Enter a descriptive name for the register (e.g., Fall 2024 Attendance or Lab Section Attendance). You can have multiple registers if needed (e.g., one for lecture, one for lab).
</Step>

<Step title="Define Attendance Statuses">
Configure the status options students can be marked with:

| Default Status | Abbreviation | Typical Use |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Present** | P | Student attended the session |
| **Absent** | A | Student did not attend |
| **Late** | L | Student arrived late |
| **Excused** | E | Absence is excused (documentation provided) |

You can customize these statuses, add new ones, or change the abbreviations and assigned percentages.
</Step>

<Step title="Set Percentage Values">
Assign a percentage value to each status that reflects how much credit students receive:
- Present: 100%
- Late: 75% or 50%
- Excused: 100% (counts as present)
- Absent: 0%

These percentages are used to calculate the overall attendance score.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Cause for Concern">
Set a threshold for when students should be flagged as at-risk:
- Example: Flag students whose attendance falls below 80%
- This helps you quickly identify students who may need intervention
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Register">
Click **Save** to create your attendance register.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Attendance Sessions

After creating a register, add sessions for each class meeting.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Your Register">
Click on your attendance register to open it.
</Step>

<Step title="Add a New Session">
Click **Add Session** or the **+** icon to create a new session.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Session Details">
- **Session Name**: Give the session a name (e.g., Week 1 - Monday or Sept 5 Lecture)
- **Date**: Enter the date of the class session
- **Description** (optional): Add notes about what was covered
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Session">
Click **Save**. The session will appear as a column in your attendance grid.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk Session Creation

For courses with regular meeting times, you can create multiple sessions at once:

1. Click **Bulk Create Sessions** (if available)
2. Select the start and end dates of your term
3. Choose which days of the week the class meets
4. Enter a naming pattern (e.g., Week n or use dates)
5. Click **Create** to generate all sessions at once

<Callout type="warning" title="Holiday Adjustments">
Bulk-created sessions do not account for holidays or breaks. Review and delete sessions that fall on days when class will not meet.
</Callout>

## Taking Attendance

Once you have sessions set up, you can record attendance for each class.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Attendance Tool">
Navigate to **Attendance** in your course.
</Step>

<Step title="Select the Session">
Find today's session in the attendance grid or click on the session column.
</Step>

<Step title="Mark Each Student">
For each student, click the status dropdown or icon to mark their attendance:
- **P** = Present
- **A** = Absent
- **L** = Late
- **E** = Excused

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to speed up entry.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Notes (Optional)">
Click on a student's attendance cell to add notes (e.g., Arrived 15 minutes late or Medical documentation provided).
</Step>

<Step title="Save Your Changes">
Attendance is typically auto-saved, but click **Save** if you see that option to ensure your entries are recorded.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Quick Attendance Entry

For faster attendance taking:

1. Click **Set Status for All Users** at the top of a session column
2. Choose the default status (e.g., Present)
3. All students are marked with that status
4. Go back and change only the exceptions (absences, late arrivals)

This is much faster than marking each student individually when most students are present.

## Viewing Attendance Data

### Attendance Grid View

The main attendance view shows:
- **Rows**: Each student in your classlist
- **Columns**: Each attendance session
- **Cells**: Status for each student/session combination
- **Summary Column**: Overall attendance percentage for each student

### Filtering and Sorting

- **Sort by name**: Click the Name column header
- **Sort by attendance**: Click the attendance percentage column
- **Filter by status**: Show only students with specific attendance patterns
- **Filter by concern**: Show only students below the cause-for-concern threshold

### Individual Student View

Click a student name to see:
- Their attendance for all sessions
- Overall attendance percentage
- Any notes associated with their attendance
- Trend over time

## Connecting Attendance to Grades

You can link attendance to your gradebook so it counts toward students final grades.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Grade Item">
In the Gradebook, create a new grade item for attendance (e.g., Class Participation or Attendance).
</Step>

<Step title="Link to Attendance Register">
When creating or editing the attendance register:
1. Look for the **Grade Item** option
2. Select the grade item you created
3. The attendance percentage will automatically sync to the gradebook
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Calculation">
Decide how attendance translates to points:
- **Direct percentage**: 95% attendance = 95/100 points
- **Tiered grading**: Set thresholds (e.g., 90%+ attendance = full credit)
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Sync Timing">
Attendance grades may not sync to the gradebook in real-time. Check periodically to ensure the sync is working, especially before final grade submission.
</Callout>

## Exporting Attendance Data

Export attendance records for reporting or backup:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Attendance">
Navigate to the Attendance tool in your course.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Export">
Click **Export** or look for an export option in the menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Format">
Select your preferred format:
- **CSV**: For spreadsheet programs (Excel, Google Sheets)
- **PDF**: For printed reports
</Step>

<Step title="Select Data Range">
Choose which sessions to include:
- All sessions
- Specific date range
- Selected sessions only
</Step>

<Step title="Download the File">
Click **Export** or **Download** to save the file to your computer.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### For Accurate Tracking

- Take attendance at a consistent time each class (beginning vs. end)
- Use the Late status rather than marking late arrivals as absent
- Add notes for unusual circumstances
- Back up your attendance data periodically by exporting

### For Student Success

- Review attendance weekly to identify at-risk students
- Reach out to students with multiple absences early
- Consider using Intelligent Agents to automate absence notifications
- Be flexible with excused absences for documented reasons

### For Grading Fairness

- Clearly communicate your attendance policy in the syllabus
- Be consistent in how you apply the policy
- Have a process for handling excused absences
- Consider whether attendance should affect grades or just be tracked

<Callout type="tip" title="Combine with Class Progress">
Use attendance data alongside Class Progress analytics to get a fuller picture of student engagement. A student logging into Brightspace but missing class (or vice versa) may need different types of support.

## Common Issues

### Students Not Appearing in Attendance

- Verify the student is enrolled in the course
- Check if they were added after the register was created
- Refresh the attendance page

### Attendance Not Syncing to Gradebook

- Verify the grade item is linked to the register
- Check that the grade item point value matches expectations
- Wait a few minutes and refresh, as sync may be delayed

### Missing Sessions

- Sessions may have been accidentally deleted
- Check if you are viewing the correct attendance register
- Recreate missing sessions and re-enter attendance data
