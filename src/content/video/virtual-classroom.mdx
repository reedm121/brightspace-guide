# Virtual Classroom Setup

## Overview

Brightspace Virtual Classroom is a browser-based tool that allows instructors to conduct live, synchronous sessions with students directly within the Brightspace environment. Powered by Bongo, this tool enables real-time video conferencing, screen sharing, interactive presentations, and collaborative learning without requiring students to leave the LMS.

Virtual Classroom is ideal for:
- Live lectures and presentations
- Virtual office hours
- Guest speaker sessions
- Group discussions and collaborative work
- Real-time Q&A sessions

## Before You Begin

- You need **Instructor** or **Teaching Assistant** permissions in the course
- Ensure your browser allows camera and microphone access
- Test your audio and video equipment before your first session
- Plan your session duration (maximum 240 minutes per session)
- Decide whether you want to record the session for later viewing

<Callout type="info" title="Participant Limits">
Virtual Classroom supports up to 150 participants per session, with up to 30 simultaneous webcams visible (10 displayed on screen at once). Sessions can run for a maximum of 240 minutes (4 hours).
</Callout>

## Virtual Classroom Options in Brightspace

Brightspace offers several options for conducting live sessions:

| Option | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Virtual Classroom (Bongo)** | Built-in tool with full Brightspace integration | Standard live sessions, recorded lectures |
| **Zoom Integration** | External tool with LTI integration | Large meetings, advanced breakout rooms |
| **Microsoft Teams** | External tool with LTI integration | Institutions using Microsoft 365 |

<Callout type="tip" title="Which Should You Choose?">
Virtual Classroom is recommended for most instructors because it is fully integrated with Brightspace, requires no additional accounts, and recordings are automatically available within your course. Use Zoom or Teams if your institution has existing licenses and you need features not available in Virtual Classroom.
