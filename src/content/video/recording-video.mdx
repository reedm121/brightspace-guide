# Recording Video in Brightspace

## Overview

Brightspace provides multiple built-in tools for recording and sharing video content with your students. Whether you need to create quick video announcements, record lectures with screen sharing, or provide personalized video feedback, Brightspace has options to meet your needs without requiring external software.

## Before You Begin

- Ensure you have a working webcam and microphone connected to your computer
- Grant your browser permission to access your camera and microphone when prompted
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended) for best compatibility
- Find a quiet location with good lighting for recording
- Plan your content - shorter, focused videos are more effective for student learning

## Video Recording Options

Brightspace offers three primary methods for recording video:

| Method | Best For | Max Length | Screen Recording | Long-term Storage |

| Video Note | Quick announcements, feedback, discussion replies | 30 minutes | No | 6 months |
| Media Library Recording | Course content, lectures | No limit | No | Permanent |
| Creator+ Capture Web | Screen recordings, presentations | No limit | Yes | Permanent |

## Video Storage and Limits

Understanding storage limits helps you plan your video content effectively.

### File Size and Length Limits

| Storage Location | Maximum File Size | Maximum Length | Retention |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Video Note | N/A (streaming) | 30 minutes | 6 months |
| Media Library | 2GB | Unlimited | Permanent |
| Uploaded videos | 2GB (1GB recommended) | Unlimited | Permanent |

<Callout type="warning" title="Large File Considerations">
While 2GB is the technical limit, keeping videos under 1GB ensures faster upload times and better streaming performance for students. Consider compressing large videos or splitting them into shorter segments.
</Callout>

### Supported Video Formats

- **.mp4** (recommended) - best compatibility
- **.mov** - Apple QuickTime format
- **.wmv** - Windows Media Video

For audio-only files: **.mp3** (preferred), .m4a, .ogg, .wav, .wma (1GB max)

### Storage Organization Tips

- Use a consistent naming convention: "Year-Semester-Course-Topic" (e.g., "2026-Spring-BIO101-CellDivision")
- Media Library stores all videos together across courses - good naming helps you find content later
- Consider which videos are course-specific vs. reusable when deciding on titles

## Video Playback Settings

Brightspace provides several options for how students view your videos.

### Playback Controls

Students can:
- Play, pause, and seek through videos
- Adjust playback speed (0.5x to 2x)
- Enable or disable closed captions
- View in full-screen mode
- Adjust volume

### Download Settings

<Callout type="info" title="Student Downloads">
Videos added via Media Library can be downloaded by students by default. If you need to prevent downloads, consider external hosting options or discuss with your IT department about available restrictions.
</Callout>

## Accessibility: Captions and Transcripts

Making your videos accessible is both a best practice and often a requirement. Brightspace provides multiple ways to add captions.

### Automatic Caption Generation

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable during recording">
When creating a Video Note or Media Library recording, check the **"Automatically generate captions from audio"** option and select the correct audio language.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate for existing videos">
In Media Library, select a video and click **Edit**. Navigate to the **Closed Captions** tab, select the audio language, and click **Auto-Generate**.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Review Auto-Captions">
Automatically generated captions often contain errors, especially with:
- Technical terminology and jargon
- Names and proper nouns
- Accented speech
- Background noise

Always review and edit auto-generated captions before publishing important content.
</Callout>

### Editing Captions

<Steps>
<Step title="Access caption editor">
Go to **Course Admin > Audio/Video Note Editor** (or access through Media Library). Select the video you want to edit.
</Step>

<Step title="Open Closed Captions tab">
Click on the **Closed Captions** tab to view and edit the caption text.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit caption text">
Use the Captions Editor to:
- Correct spelling and grammar errors

- Correct misheard words
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
Click **Save** when finished. Changes apply everywhere the video is embedded.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Uploading Caption Files

If you have professionally created captions or transcripts:

<Step title="Access video settings">
In Media Library, select your video and click **Edit**.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Closed Captions">

</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Educational Videos

Creating effective educational videos requires attention to both technical and pedagogical considerations.

### Content Planning

- **Keep videos short**: Aim for 6-12 minutes maximum. Students retain information better from shorter, focused videos
- **One topic per video**: Cover a single concept or skill in each recording
- **Create an outline**: Plan your key points before recording
- **Include learning objectives**: State what students will learn at the beginning

### Technical Quality

- **Lighting**: Position yourself facing a window or light source. Avoid backlighting
- **Audio**: Use an external microphone if possible. Record in a quiet space
- **Camera position**: Position your webcam at eye level for natural appearance
- **Background**: Choose a clean, uncluttered background

### Engagement Strategies

- **Speak conversationally**: Address students directly as "you"
- **Vary your delivery**: Change your tone and pacing to maintain interest
- **Use visuals**: When screen recording, highlight important elements with cursor movements or annotations
- **Include check-points**: Pose questions or pause points for student reflection

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Always provide captions**: Required for accessibility and helpful for all students
- **Describe visual content**: If showing something on screen, verbally describe what students see
- **Provide transcripts**: Consider offering downloadable transcripts for longer lectures
- **Use sufficient contrast**: When showing slides or demonstrations, ensure text is readable

<Callout type="tip" title="Student Preferences">
Research shows many students prefer watching videos at 1.5x or 2x speed. Recording at a slightly slower, deliberate pace allows students to speed up playback without losing comprehension.
</Callout>
