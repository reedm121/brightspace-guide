# Video Assignments

## Overview

Video assignments allow students to submit recorded video responses for presentations, reflections, demonstrations, and other multimedia projects. Brightspace supports multiple methods for video submissions, from simple file uploads to embedded streaming video through integrated platforms like Kaltura, Panopto, or YuJa.

<Callout type="info" title="Submission Type Matters">
The key to successful video assignments is choosing the right submission type. For embedded, streamable video submissions, use **Text Submission** so students can access the HTML editor with Insert Stuff functionality. For simple file uploads, use **File Submission**.
</Callout>

## Before You Begin

- Determine which video submission method works best for your assignment (file upload vs. embedded video)
- Check with your institution which video platforms are integrated (Kaltura, Panopto, YuJa, Bongo, etc.)
- Consider file size limits and storage constraints
- Plan your grading approach (rubric, inline feedback, video feedback)
- Ensure students know how to record and submit videos before the deadline

## Setting Up Video Submission Assignments

There are two primary approaches to collecting video submissions: file uploads and embedded video through the HTML editor.

### Method 1: Text Submission (Recommended for Embedded Video)

This method allows students to embed videos directly from integrated platforms, making viewing and grading seamless.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a New Assignment">
Navigate to **Assessments** > **Assignments** and click **New Assignment**. Enter a descriptive title that indicates this is a video assignment (e.g., "Video Presentation: Course Topic").
</Step>

<Step title="Set Submission Type to Text">
In the **Submission & Completion** panel on the right side, change the submission type from "File Submission" to **Text Submission**.

<Callout type="tip" title="Why Text Submission?">
Text Submission provides students with the full HTML editor, including the **Insert Stuff** button. This allows them to embed videos from Kaltura, Panopto, YuJa, or other integrated platforms so videos play directly in Brightspace.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Write Clear Instructions">
In the Instructions field, explain:
- What video platform students should use (Kaltura, Panopto, Video Note, etc.)
- Recording requirements (length, content, format)
- How to embed the video using Insert Stuff
- Any technical requirements (lighting, audio quality, etc.)

Example instructions:
```
## Video Presentation Requirements

Record a 3-5 minute video presentation on your assigned topic.

### How to Submit
1. Record your video using Kaltura My Media or upload an existing video
2. Click the "Insert Stuff" button below
3. Select your video platform (Kaltura, Panopto, etc.)
4. Choose your video and click Insert
5. Click Submit

### Technical Requirements
- Clear audio (use a quiet location)
- Good lighting (face a window or light source)
- Stable camera (use a tripod or prop your device)
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Dates and Settings">
Set your start date, due date, and end date. For video assignments, consider allowing extra time for students to troubleshoot technical issues.
</Step>

<Step title="Link to Gradebook (Optional)">
Connect the assignment to a grade item if you want grades to sync with your gradebook.
</Step>

<Step title="Make Visible and Save">
Toggle the **Visibility** switch to make the assignment visible to students, then click **Save and Close**.
</Step>

</Steps>

### Method 2: File Submission (Direct Upload)

Use this method when students need to upload video files directly rather than embedding from a video platform.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create Assignment with File Submission">
Create a new assignment and keep the default **File Submission** type.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure File Settings">
Under Submission & Completion:
- **Files Allowed Per Submission**: Usually "One File" for video assignments
- **Submission File Types**: Optionally restrict to video formats (.mp4, .mov, .webm)

<Callout type="warning" title="File Size Limits">
The default maximum file size in Brightspace is typically 1GB per file, though some institutions may have different limits. Files larger than 1.5GB may experience upload issues. Advise students to compress videos if needed.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Provide Format Guidelines">
In your instructions, specify:
- Preferred format: MP4 is recommended (plays directly in browser)
- Maximum file size
- Video length requirements
- File naming convention
</Step>

<Step title="Save and Publish">
Complete the remaining settings and make the assignment visible to students.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Student Recording Options

Students have several options for recording and submitting video:

### Video Note (Built-in Tool)

Video Note is Brightspace's native webcam recording tool, available anywhere the HTML editor appears.

**Features:**
- No external software needed
- Records directly in browser
- 30-minute maximum recording length
- Automatic upload to Brightspace
- Audio-only option available

**Limitations:**
- Cannot be downloaded or embedded elsewhere
- Videos only accessible within the original Brightspace course
- Best for one-time, course-specific recordings

<Callout type="info" title="Best Use Cases for Video Note">
Video Note works well for discussion responses, quick reflections, assignment feedback, and informal video responses under 30 minutes.
</Callout>

### Integrated Video Platforms

Most institutions integrate one or more video platforms with Brightspace:

| Platform | Key Features |
|----------|--------------|
| **Kaltura** | Unlimited storage, editing tools, auto-captioning |
| **Panopto** | Lecture capture, screen recording, searchable transcripts |
| **YuJa** | Multi-camera recording, video editing, analytics |
| **Bongo** | Video assignments, peer review, group projects |

Students access these through the **Insert Stuff** button in the HTML editor.

### External Recording

Students can also:
- Record on their phone or computer and upload the file
- Use screen recording software (OBS, Loom, Screencast-O-Matic)
- Record with Zoom and upload the recording

## Video File Size and Format Requirements

### Supported Video Formats

| Format | Browser Support | Recommendation |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **.mp4** | All browsers | **Recommended** - plays embedded |
| **.webm** | Most browsers | Good alternative |
| **.mov** | Limited | May appear as download link only |
| **.wmv** | Limited | May require download to view |
| **.flv/.f4v** | Limited | Legacy format, avoid if possible |

<Callout type="tip" title="MP4 is Best">
Always recommend MP4 format for video submissions. It has the widest browser compatibility and can be embedded directly in Brightspace without requiring a download.
</Callout>

### File Size Considerations

| Scenario | Limit | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Standard file upload | 1-2 GB | Institution-dependent |
| Video Note upload | ~5 MB default | Configurable by admin |
