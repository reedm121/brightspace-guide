# Grades

## What is the Gradebook?

The **Gradebook** (also called **Grades**) is where you track and calculate student grades in Brightspace. It's the central hub for all grading activities—entering scores, calculating totals, viewing student progress, and releasing final grades.

The Gradebook connects to assignments, quizzes, and discussions, automatically receiving scores from those tools. You can also create grade items for work assessed outside of Brightspace.

## Why Use the Gradebook?

A properly configured Gradebook provides significant benefits:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Automatic Calculations** | Weighted categories and running totals calculate automatically |
| **Integration** | Scores from assignments and quizzes flow in automatically |
| **Transparency** | Students see their grades and understand how they're calculated |
| **Efficiency** | Grade multiple students quickly with spreadsheet-like entry |
| **Flexibility** | Support for points, weighted, or formula-based grading |
| **Export** | Send grades to your institution's student information system |

Configure your Gradebook at the start of the semester. A well-organized Gradebook saves hours of work later and helps students understand expectations from day one.

## Understanding Gradebook Structure

The Brightspace Gradebook has a hierarchical structure:

```
Gradebook
├── Categories (optional groupings)
│   ├── Grade Item (e.g., "Homework 1")
│   ├── Grade Item (e.g., "Homework 2")
│   └── Grade Item (e.g., "Homework 3")
├── Final Calculated Grade
└── Final Adjusted Grade
```

### Grade Items
Individual graded elements in your course:
- Linked to assignments, quizzes, or discussions
- Or manually created for in-class work, participation, etc.

### Categories
Optional groupings for organizing grade items:
- "Homework" with 10 assignments
- "Exams" with midterm and final
- "Participation" with weekly entries
- Categories can have their own weighting and rules

### Final Grade
The calculated overall course grade:
- **Final Calculated Grade**: Automatically computed from your grading scheme
- **Final Adjusted Grade**: Manually adjusted (for instructor overrides)

## Grading Systems

Brightspace supports several grading approaches:

| System | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Points** | Total points earned / total points possible | Simple courses with few grade items |
| **Weighted** | Categories have percentage weights (e.g., Exams 40%) | Most courses with multiple assignment types |
| **Formula** | Custom calculations using Brightspace formulas | Complex grading schemes |

<Callout type="info" title="Most Common">
The **Weighted** system is most commonly used. For example: Homework 20%, Quizzes 20%, Midterm 25%, Final 35%.

## Gradebook Workflow

A typical Gradebook workflow:

```
1. Run Setup Wizard (start of semester)
   ↓
2. Create Categories (Homework, Exams, etc.)
   ↓
3. Create Grade Items (or let activities auto-create them)
   ↓
4. Link Activities to Grade Items
   ↓
5. Set Grade Scheme (letter grade cutoffs)
   ↓
6. Throughout Semester: Grade Work
   ↓
7. Scores Flow to Gradebook Automatically
   ↓
8. End of Semester: Calculate Final Grades
   ↓
9. Export to Student Information System
```

## Best Practices

### Initial Setup
- Use the Setup Wizard for guided configuration
- Match your syllabus grading breakdown exactly
- Create all categories before adding grade items
- Test with a "fake" student to verify calculations

### During the Semester
- Don't manually override calculated grades unless necessary
- Use "exempt" for students who shouldn't have an item counted
- Keep grade items named consistently with their linked activities
- Check for ungraded items regularly

### Grade Visibility
- Keep the Final Grade hidden until the end of the term
- Consider showing running totals so students know where they stand
- Release grades promptly after assignments are graded

### End of Semester
- Review all incomplete or missing grades
- Check final grade calculations carefully
- Use Final Adjusted Grade only when necessary
- Export and back up grades before term ends

## Common Questions

**What's the difference between Final Calculated and Final Adjusted Grade?**
- **Final Calculated**: Automatically computed based on your grading scheme
- **Final Adjusted**: A manual override you can set (use sparingly)

**Why isn't a grade showing up in the Gradebook?**
Check that the activity (assignment/quiz) is properly linked to a grade item. If you created them separately, you need to connect them.

**Can students see their grades?**
Yes, unless you've hidden specific items or the entire Gradebook. Students see their own grades only—not classmates' grades.

**How do I drop the lowest score?**
Configure this in the category settings. You can drop lowest, drop highest, or keep only the best N scores.

**Can I import grades from Excel?**
Yes, export the Gradebook to CSV, edit in Excel, then import the updated CSV back into Brightspace.
