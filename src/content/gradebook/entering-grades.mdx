# Entering and Managing Grades

## Overview

This guide covers all the essential methods for entering, managing, and releasing grades in Brightspace. You'll learn how to efficiently grade student work using different view options, leverage Quick Eval for streamlined grading across courses, manage grade overrides and exemptions, and control how and when students see their grades.

## Before You Begin

- Your gradebook should be set up with grade categories and items
- Assignments, quizzes, or discussions should be linked to grade items
- You need Instructor or TA permissions for the course

## Entering Grades in the Gradebook

Brightspace offers two main views for entering grades: Standard View and Spreadsheet View.

### Standard View (Default)

Standard View allows you to enter grades for individual grade items or individual students.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Grades tool">
Navigate to your course and click **Grades** in the navbar, then select the **Enter Grades** tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose your entry method">
You have several options:
- Click on a **learner's name** to enter all grades for that student
- Click the **context menu** (dropdown arrow) next to a grade item and select **Enter Grades** to grade all students for that item
- Click on a **submission icon** next to a learner's name to evaluate specific work
</Step>

<Step title="Enter the grade">
Input the numeric grade or select from a grade scheme if applicable. You can also add feedback in the provided fields.
</Step>

<Step title="Save your work">
Click **Save and Close** to save your entries and return to the Enter Grades view.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Submission Indicators">
Look for indicator dots next to submission icons to identify new, ungraded submissions that need your attention.
</Callout>

### Spreadsheet View

Spreadsheet View provides a grid-like interface ideal for bulk grade entry across multiple students and grade items.

<Steps>
<Step title="Switch to Spreadsheet View">
From the **Enter Grades** tab, click **Switch to Spreadsheet View** at the top of the page.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter grades in the grid">
Click on any cell at the intersection of a student row and grade item column. Type the numeric grade directly into the cell.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate efficiently">
Use Tab to move between cells, or click directly on the cells you need to edit. This is especially efficient when entering grades for offline assessments like presentations or participation.
</Step>

<Step title="Save all changes">
Click **Save** to record all your entries before leaving the page.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="When to Use Spreadsheet View">
Spreadsheet View is ideal for entering grades for assessments that occur outside of Brightspace, such as in-class presentations, participation grades, or offline midterm exams.
</Callout>

## Using Quick Eval for Efficient Grading

Quick Eval is Brightspace's most powerful grading tool, allowing you to view and evaluate all pending student submissions across courses in one centralized location.

### Accessing Quick Eval

<Steps>
<Step title="From the Brightspace homepage">
Click **Quick Eval** in the top navbar on your Brightspace homepage to see submissions from all your courses.
</Step>

<Step title="From within a course">
Navigate to **Course Tools** > **Quick Eval** to see only submissions from that specific course.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Two Views in Quick Eval

**Submissions View**: Shows all individual student submissions awaiting evaluation. Best for grading one submission at a time.

**Activities View**: Shows a summary of all activities with submission counts, evaluation progress, and publication status. Best for getting an overview and publishing multiple grades at once.

### Grading with Quick Eval

<Steps>
<Step title="Filter your submissions">
Use the **Filters** dropdown to narrow results by:
- Activity Name
- Course (when using multi-course Quick Eval)
- Submission Date

You can also use the search function to find specific students.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a submission">
Click on a student's name or the activity to open the evaluation screen.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter the grade">
Type the grade in the **Overall Grade** field. If a rubric is attached, click to apply rubric scores.
</Step>

<Step title="Provide feedback">
Use the feedback editor to add comments. You can include:
- Text feedback
- Audio feedback
- Video feedback
- Inline annotations on the submission
</Step>

<Step title="Publish or save as draft">
- Click **Publish** to immediately release the grade and feedback to the student
- Click **Save Draft** to save your work without releasing it to the student
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Publish vs Save Draft">
When you **Publish**, the grade is released to the student and the submission is removed from your Quick Eval list. Use **Save Draft** if you want to review all grades before releasing them together.
</Callout>

### Publishing Multiple Grades at Once

<Steps>
<Step title="Switch to Activities View">
Click on the **Activities** tab in Quick Eval.
</Step>

<Step title="Find the activity">
Locate the activity you want to publish grades for. You'll see counts for Completed, Evaluated, and Published.
</Step>

<Step title="Publish all drafts">
Hover over the activity, click **More Actions**, and select **Publish All** to release all saved draft grades at once.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Bulk Grade Entry

For entering grades in bulk outside of individual submission grading:

<Steps>
<Step title="Use Spreadsheet View">
Switch to Spreadsheet View as described above for quick entry of multiple grades.
</Step>

<Step title="Send bulk emails">
From the Enter Grades tab, select checkboxes next to student names, then use the bulk email option to communicate grade-related information to multiple students at once.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Grade Overrides

Brightspace distinguishes between calculated grades (computed automatically) and adjusted/override grades (entered manually).

### Understanding Calculated vs Override Grades

| Grade Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Calculated Grade** | Automatically computed based on grade item scores and your gradebook settings |
| **Adjusted/Override Grade** | Manually entered grade that replaces the calculated grade |

<Callout type="info" title="When Overrides Apply">
If you enter a grade in the Final Grade Override column, that grade will be used instead of the calculated grade. If no override is entered, the calculated grade is used.
</Callout>

### Entering a Final Grade Override

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Enter Grades">
Go to **Grades** > **Enter Grades** in your course.
</Step>

<Step title="Find the Final Adjusted Grade column">
Scroll right to locate the **Final Adjusted Grade** column.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter the override">
Click on a student's cell in this column and enter the adjusted grade. This could be a numeric value or a letter grade depending on your grade scheme.
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
Click **Save** to apply the override.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Exempting Students from Grade Items

When you exempt a student from a grade item, that item is treated as if it doesn't exist for that student. This is different from giving a zero.

### How Exemptions Work

- Exempted items are completely excluded from grade calculations
- The weight of exempted items is redistributed proportionally to remaining items
- Exemptions are treated as null values, not as zeros
- If all items in a category are exempted, the category has no score

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the grade item">
Go to **Grades** > **Enter Grades** and click on the grade item context menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Enter Grades">
Choose **Enter Grades** to see all students for that item.
</Step>

<Step title="Exempt the student">
Find the student you want to exempt and click the **Exempt** checkbox or icon next to their grade cell.
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
Click **Save** to apply the exemption.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Exemption Limitations">
You cannot exempt students from the Final Calculated Grade or Final Adjusted Grade items. Exemptions only apply to individual grade items and categories.
</Callout>

## Viewing Grade History

Brightspace maintains a history of grade changes, which can be useful for auditing or resolving disputes.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the student's grades">
Go to **Grades** > **Enter Grades** and click on the student's name.
</Step>

<Step title="Find the grade item">
Locate the specific grade item you want to review.
</Step>

<Step title="View the Event Log">
Click on the grade item's context menu and select **Event Log** or **View History** to see a record of grade changes, including the date, time, and values.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Student Grade Preview

You can view how grades appear to students to ensure they see what you intend.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Class Progress">
Navigate to **Course Tools** > **Class Progress** in your course.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a student">
Click on a student's name to view their progress summary, including how their grades appear.
</Step>

<Step title="Check the Grades section">
Review the grades section to see the student's view of their current standing.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Eye Icons">
In the Enter Grades view, look for the eye icon next to grades. An open eye means the grade is visible to the student. An eye with a slash means it's hidden.
</Callout>

## Releasing Grades to Students

You can control whether grades are released automatically or manually.

### Automatic Release

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Grade Settings">
Go to **Grades** > **Settings** (gear icon in the top right).
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Calculation Options">
Click on the **Calculation Options** tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable automatic release">
Scroll to **Final Grade Released** and check **Automatically release final grade**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable auto-update">
Check **Automatically keep final grades updated** to ensure grades refresh as new scores are entered.
</Step>

<Step title="Save settings">

Click the dropdown arrow next to **Final Calculated Grade** or **Final Adjusted Grade** and select **Enter Grades**.
</Step>

<Step title="Select students">
Check the boxes next to the students whose grades you want to release.
</Step>

<Step title="Release the grades">
Click **Release/Unrelease** to toggle the visibility of grades for selected students.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Hiding Individual Grade Items

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Manage Grades">
Navigate to **Grades** > **Manage Grades**.
</Step>

<Step title="Find the grade item">
Locate the grade item you want to hide.
</Step>

<Step title="Hide from users">
Click the dropdown arrow next to the item and select **Hide from Users**.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Grade Release Strategy">
Consider keeping grades hidden until you've finished grading all students for an assignment. This prevents confusion when some students see grades before others.
</Callout>

## Exporting Grades

You can export grades to CSV or Excel for external use or backup.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Enter Grades">
Go to **Grades** > **Enter Grades**.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Export">
Click the **Export** button at the top of the page.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure export options">

- **Users**: All users or specific groups/sections
- **Grade Values**: Points grade, Weighted grade, and/or Grade Scheme
</Step>

<Step title="Choose format">
Click **Export to CSV** or **Export to Excel**.
</Step>

<Step title="Download the file">
Once the export is complete, click **Download** to save the file to your computer.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Large Export Times">
If you have many students (1000+) or many grade items, exporting the entire gradebook may take a long time. Consider exporting individual grade items for faster results.
</Callout>

## Importing Grades

You can import grades from a CSV file, which is useful for grades calculated externally or transferred from other systems.

### File Format Requirements

Brightspace accepts `.csv`, `.txt`, and `.tsv` files. Excel files must be converted to CSV first.

**Required columns:**
- **Username** or **Org Defined ID** (identifying column, must be first)
- **Grade Item Name followed by value type** (e.g., "Test 1 Points Grade")
- **End-of-Line Indicator** (required at the end)

<Steps>
<Step title="Create grade items first">
Ensure all grade items exist in Brightspace before importing. This ensures proper column matching.
</Step>

<Step title="Export a template">
Export your current gradebook to get a properly formatted template file.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit the file">
Add or modify grades in the exported file using Excel or a text editor. Keep the column headers unchanged.
</Step>

<Step title="Go to Enter Grades">
Navigate to **Grades** > **Enter Grades**.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Import">
Click the **Import** button at the top of the page.
</Step>

<Step title="Upload your file">
Browse for your CSV file and select it.
</Step>

<Step title="Map columns">
Verify that Brightspace correctly maps your columns to the appropriate grade items.
</Step>

<Step title="Complete the import">
Click **Continue** and then **Import** to finalize the process.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Import Issues">
- Ensure no extra commas exist after the End-of-Line Indicator
- Column names must exactly match grade item names plus the value type (e.g., "Quiz 1 Points Grade")
- If using European Excel, convert semicolon delimiters to commas
</Callout>

## Common Issues

### Grades not showing for students
- Check if the grade item is set to "Hide from Users"
- Verify the grade release settings are configured correctly
- Look for the eye icon - a slashed eye means hidden

### Calculated grade not updating
- Go to **Settings** > **Calculation Options** and ensure "Automatically keep final grades updated" is checked
- Try manually recalculating by clicking the grade item context menu and selecting "Recalculate All"

### Import failing
- Ensure the file is saved as CSV (not Excel format)
- Check that column headers match exactly
- Remove any hidden columns or extra commas
- Open the file in a text editor to verify formatting
