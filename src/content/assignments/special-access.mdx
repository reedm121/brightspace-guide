# Managing Special Access for Students

## Overview

Special Access in Brightspace allows you to provide individualized accommodations for specific students on assignments and quizzes. Whether you need to grant extended time for a student with a documented disability, offer a different due date for someone who missed class due to illness, or allow additional attempts for a makeup assessment, Special Access gives you the flexibility to customize access without affecting the rest of your class.

<Callout type="info" title="Special Access vs. Accommodations">
Brightspace offers two methods for student accommodations:
- **Special Access**: Applied to individual assignments or quizzes. Use this for one-time extensions or quiz-specific adjustments.
- **Accommodations (Classlist)**: Applied at the course level and automatically affects ALL quizzes. Use this for students who need extended time on every quiz (e.g., documented disability accommodations).
</Callout>

## Before You Begin

- Ensure you have Instructor or TA permissions in the course
- Know which students require accommodations and what type they need
- For disability accommodations, verify the student's Letter of Accommodation from your institution's accessibility services
- Have the assignment or quiz already created

## What Special Access Can Modify

Special Access allows you to customize the following settings for individual students:

| Setting | Assignments | Quizzes |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Start Date | Yes | Yes |
| Due Date | Yes | Yes |
| End Date | Yes | Yes |
| Time Limit | N/A | Yes |
| Time Limit Multiplier | N/A | Yes |
| Extra Time (minutes) | N/A | Yes |
| Number of Attempts | No* | Yes |

*Assignments allow multiple submissions by default unless restricted in settings.

## Adding Special Access to Assignments

<Steps>

<Step title="Navigate to the Assignment">
From your course navbar, click **Assessments** and select **Assignments**. Find the assignment you want to modify and click the dropdown arrow next to its name, then select **Edit Assignment**.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Special Access Settings">
On the assignment editing page, locate the **Availability Dates & Conditions** panel on the right side. Click on it to expand the options, then click **Manage Special Access**.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose the Access Type">
In the Manage Special Access dialog, select one of these options:

- **Allow users with special access to submit outside the normal availability dates for this folder** - Students with special access can access the assignment outside standard dates, while all other students access it normally. This is the most common choice.

- **Allow only users with special access to see this folder** - Only students you add to special access can see this assignment at all. Use this for makeup assignments or individual accommodations where the assignment shouldn't be visible to others.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Users to Special Access">
Click **Add Users to Special Access**. A new dialog will open where you can configure the accommodation settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Date Overrides">
Adjust any of the following dates as needed for the student(s):

- **Has Start Date**: When the student can first access the assignment
- **Has Due Date**: The student's individual deadline (submissions after this are marked late)
- **Has End Date**: The final cutoff after which the student cannot submit

<Callout type="tip" title="Leaving Dates Unchanged">
Options not changed on this page will match the settings for other learners. You only need to modify the specific dates that are different for the student.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Select the Student(s)">
Scroll down to the **Users** section. Check the box next to each student who needs this special access configuration.

<Callout type="warning" title="Search Clears Settings">
**Important**: If you use the search function to find a student, you must re-enter your special access settings afterward. Searching resets the date fields. Enter dates first, then scroll to find students, OR search first, then go back and set the dates.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Save Special Access">
Click **Save** to apply the special access settings. You'll see a summary of all students with special access listed.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the Settings">
After saving, a key icon will appear next to the assignment name on the Assignments page, indicating that special access has been configured.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Adding Special Access to Quizzes

Quizzes offer more extensive special access options, including time limit modifications.

<Steps>

<Step title="Navigate to the Quiz">
From your course navbar, click **Assessments** and select **Quizzes**. Click on the quiz name to edit it.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Special Access Settings">
In the quiz editor, click on **Availability Dates & Conditions** in the left panel. Then click **Manage Special Access**.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose the Access Type">
Select one of the following:

- **Allow selected users special access to this quiz** - Students with special access get customized settings while all other students access the quiz normally.

- **Allow only users with special access to see this quiz** - Only students you designate can see and attempt the quiz.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Users to Special Access">
Click **Add Users to Special Access** to open the configuration dialog.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Timing Settings">
Under the **Timing** section:

- Check **Override time limit** to modify the time allowed
- Choose from:
  - **Set time limit**: Enter a specific time in minutes
  - **Multiplier of original time**: e.g., 1.5 for time-and-a-half, 2.0 for double time
  - **Extra time**: Add a specific number of additional minutes
  - **No time limit**: Remove the time restriction entirely

<Callout type="info" title="Multiplier vs. Extra Time">
- Use **Multiplier** for consistent percentage-based accommodations (e.g., "time-and-a-half" = 1.5x)
- Use **Extra Time** when a specific number of additional minutes is needed regardless of quiz length
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Timer Behavior (Optional)">
Check **Override behavior when time limit is exceeded** if you want to change how the quiz responds when time runs out. Options include:
- Automatically submit the quiz
- Flag as exceeded but allow continued work
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Date Overrides">
Adjust the Start Date, Due Date, and End Date as needed for the student.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Attempt Overrides">

</Step>

<Step title="Select Students and Save">
Scroll to the Users section, check the boxes next to the students who need this accommodation, then click **Add Special Access**.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Extended Time vs. Different Due Dates

Understanding when to use each type of accommodation:

### Extended Time (Quizzes Only)

Use extended time when a student needs more time to complete a timed assessment but should still access it during the same availability window as other students.

**Example scenarios:**
- A student with a documented learning disability requiring 1.5x time
- A student with a visual impairment who needs extra time to read questions
- A student using assistive technology that slows navigation

### Different Due Dates (Assignments and Quizzes)

Use different due dates when a student needs to access or submit work at a different time than the class.

**Example scenarios:**
- A student who was ill and needs an extension
- A student with a religious observance conflict
- A student athlete with a competition during the exam period
- A makeup quiz for a student who had an emergency

<Callout type="tip" title="Combining Options">
For quizzes, you can combine both extended time AND different dates. For example, a student might need time-and-a-half AND a later start time due to a scheduling conflict.
</Callout>

## Allowing Additional Attempts

For quizzes, you can grant students extra attempts beyond what the rest of the class receives.

<Steps>

<Step title="Access Special Access for the Quiz">
Navigate to the quiz, click edit, then go to **Availability Dates & Conditions** > **Manage Special Access**.
</Step>

<Step title="Add or Edit Student Access">
Click **Add Users to Special Access** or edit an existing special access entry by clicking the pencil icon.
</Step>

<Step title="Override Attempts">
Under the **Attempts** section:
- Check **Override attempts allowed**
- Select the number of attempts from the dropdown (this sets the TOTAL attempts, not additional attempts)
- Click **Apply**
</Step>

<Step title="Save Changes">
Select the student(s) and click **Add Special Access** or **Save**.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Attempts Are Total, Not Additional">
The attempts number you set is the TOTAL number of attempts for that student, not additional attempts. If the class gets 2 attempts and you want to give a student 1 extra, set their special access attempts to 3.
</Callout>

## Using Course-Level Accommodations (Classlist)

For students who need the same accommodation on ALL quizzes throughout the course, use the Classlist Accommodations feature instead of setting special access on each individual quiz.

<Steps>

<Step title="Navigate to Classlist">
From your course, go to **Course Admin** or click **Communication** > **Classlist**.
</Step>

<Step title="Find the Student">
Locate the student who needs accommodations. Click the dropdown arrow next to their name.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit Accommodations">
Select **Edit Accommodations** from the dropdown menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Quiz Accommodations">
Under the **Timing** section:
- Check **Modify time limit**
- Choose either:
  - **Multiplier of original quiz time limit**: e.g., 1.5 for time-and-a-half
  - **Extra time**: A specific number of additional minutes

Under **Additional Options**:
- You can enable **Right-click** if the student uses assistive technology that requires it
</Step>

<Step title="Save Accommodations">
Click **Save**. These settings will automatically apply to ALL quizzes in the course.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Accommodations vs. Special Access">
Course-level Accommodations:
- Apply automatically to all quizzes
- Only affect time limits and right-click
- Cannot change dates or attempt limits

Special Access:
- Must be set per quiz/assignment
- Can modify dates, attempts, AND time limits
- More work but more control
</Callout>

## Adding Special Access to Multiple Students at Once

You can grant the same special access settings to multiple students simultaneously.

<Steps>

<Step title="Configure Settings First">
In the Add Users to Special Access dialog, set all your date, timing, and attempt overrides before selecting students.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Multiple Students">
In the Users section, check the boxes next to ALL students who should receive these same settings.

<Callout type="tip" title="Filter by Group">
Use the **View By** dropdown to filter students by group. This makes it easy to give an entire group special access (e.g., for a section that meets at a different time).
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Save for All Selected Students">
Click **Add Special Access** or **Save**. All selected students will receive the same special access configuration.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Best Practices for Accommodations

### Work with Accessibility Services

- Always verify accommodation requirements through official channels (Letters of Accommodation, Disability Services office)
- Document all accommodations provided in case of disputes
- Contact your institution's accessibility office if you're unsure what accommodations are needed

### Privacy Considerations

- Do not announce or discuss individual accommodations publicly
- Avoid asking students to disclose their disability or reasons for accommodations in class
- Use Brightspace's built-in tools rather than manual workarounds that might expose accommodation information

### Setting Up Accommodations Efficiently

- For students needing extended time on ALL quizzes, use Course-Level Accommodations via Classlist
- For one-time extensions or makeup assessments, use per-assignment/quiz Special Access
- Set up course-level accommodations at the beginning of the term to avoid forgetting

### Communication with Students

- Confirm with students that their accommodations are working correctly
- Provide a practice quiz so students can verify their extended time appears correctly
- Include your contact information in case of technical issues during timed assessments

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Pitfalls">
- **Forgetting to save**: Always click Save after making changes
- **Search resetting settings**: Enter dates/times before searching for students
- **Setting attempts wrong**: Remember, the number is TOTAL attempts, not additional
- **Missing quizzes**: Remember to set special access on each new quiz, OR use course-level accommodations
</Callout>

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Student says they don't have extended time | Verify special access is saved; check course-level accommodations in Classlist |
| Special access not appearing on quiz | Ensure you clicked Save; refresh the page and check for the key icon |
| Student can't access assignment after due date | Check that End Date (not just Due Date) is extended in special access |
| Time multiplier not calculating correctly | Verify the base quiz time limit is set; multipliers work on the original time |
| Can't find student in special access list | Check enrollment status; use search or scroll through the full list |
| Key icon missing but settings are saved | Refresh the page; the icon should appear after saving |
