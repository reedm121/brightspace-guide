# Assignments

## What is the Assignments Tool?

The **Assignments** tool (also called **Dropbox** in some Brightspace versions) is where students submit their work and instructors collect, grade, and provide feedback. It's the primary tool for managing any work students need to turn in—essays, projects, reports, presentations, and more.

<Callout type="info" title="Naming Note">
D2L has used both "Assignments" and "Dropbox" to refer to this tool. Your institution may use either term. They refer to the same feature.
</Callout>

## Why Use Assignments?

The Assignments tool provides significant advantages over collecting work via email:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Organization** | All submissions in one place, organized by student |
| **Deadlines** | Automatic date/time enforcement with late submission tracking |
| **Anonymity Options** | Grade without seeing student names to reduce bias |
| **Plagiarism Detection** | Integrate with Turnitin for originality checking |
| **Inline Feedback** | Annotate directly on submitted documents |
| **Gradebook Integration** | Scores sync automatically to the gradebook |
| **Rubric Support** | Apply rubrics for consistent, transparent grading |

## Understanding Assignment Types

Brightspace supports several submission types:

### File Submissions
Students upload files from their computer. You can:
- Restrict allowed file types (e.g., only PDF, only Word documents)
- Set maximum file size limits
- Allow multiple files per submission

### Text Submissions
Students type directly into a text box in Brightspace. Useful for:
- Short responses
- Reflections
- Situations where you want to prevent formatting issues

### Observed in Person
No file submission required—used for:
- In-class presentations
- Lab work
- Performances
- Any work assessed in person

### On Paper
Students submit physical work. The assignment folder exists only to:
- Record grades
- Provide feedback
- Keep a digital record of the paper submission

<Callout type="tip" title="Combination Approach">
You can allow multiple submission types on a single assignment. For example, students might submit a written report (file) AND a reflection (text) for the same assignment.

## Accessing Assignments

To access the Assignments tool:

1. From your course navbar, click **Assignments** (or **Activities** > **Assignments**)
2. You'll see a list of all assignment folders in your course

From here you can create new assignments, view submissions, and grade student work.

## Key Features

- Download all submissions as a ZIP file
- See submission timestamps and late status
- Allow students to resubmit (with or without instructor approval)

### Grading Tools
- **Inline Annotation**: Mark up PDFs, Word docs, and images directly
- **Rubric Grading**: Apply pre-built rubrics for consistent scoring
- **Quick Eval**: Grade across multiple assignments efficiently
- **Audio/Video Feedback**: Record feedback instead of typing

### Academic Integrity
- **Turnitin Integration**: Check submissions for plagiarism
- **Anonymous Grading**: Hide student names while grading
- **Submission Receipts**: Students receive confirmation of successful submission

### Flexibility
- **Special Access**: Extend deadlines for individual students
- **Group Submissions**: One student submits on behalf of the group

## Best Practices

### Setting Up Assignments
- Use clear, descriptive names ("Week 3 Reflection" not "Assignment 2")
- Include detailed instructions in the assignment description
- Specify file format requirements if you have preferences
- Test the submission process yourself before the deadline

### Managing Deadlines
- Set both a **Due Date** (when it's expected) and an **End Date** (when submissions close)
- Decide your late policy before creating assignments
- Use Special Access for accommodations rather than changing the main deadline

### Providing Feedback
- Use inline annotations so students can see feedback in context
- Be specific about what was done well and what needs improvement
- Consider audio/video feedback for complex feedback

## Common Questions

**What's the difference between Due Date and End Date?**
- **Due Date**: When the assignment is expected. Submissions after this are marked "late"
- **End Date**: When the submission folder closes. Students cannot submit after this

**Can students see each other's submissions?**
Not by default. You must explicitly enable peer review or portfolio sharing for students to see each other's work.

**What happens if a student submits the wrong file?**
Depending on your settings, students may be able to resubmit. You can also manually allow resubmission for specific students.

**Can I grade assignments on my phone or tablet?**
Yes, the Brightspace Pulse mobile app supports basic grading, and the web interface works on tablets.
