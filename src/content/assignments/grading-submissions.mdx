# Viewing and Grading Submissions

## Overview

Brightspace provides comprehensive tools for viewing, annotating, and grading student assignment submissions. This guide covers the complete workflow from accessing submissions to publishing feedback, including annotation tools, audio/video feedback options, and bulk download features.

## Before You Begin

- You must have instructor or TA access to the course
- Students must have submitted work to the assignment folder
- For annotation tools, ensure they were enabled when creating the assignment
- For rubric grading, the rubric must be attached to the assignment beforehand

## Accessing the Submission Inbox

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Assignments">
From your course navbar, select **Activities** (or **Tools**), then click **Assignments** from the dropdown menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Locate Your Assignment">
Find the assignment you want to grade in the Assignments table. Assignments with submissions will show a number indicating how many submissions have been received.
</Step>

<Step title="Open Submissions View">
Click the dropdown arrow next to the assignment name to expand the actions menu. Select **View Submissions** to access the submission inbox.
</Step>

</Callout>

## Viewing Submitted Files

<Steps>
<Step title="Select a Submission">
From the submission list, click on a student's name, their submission file, or the **Evaluate** link to open their submission.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Document">
The document viewer will display the submitted file. Supported file types include PDF, Word documents, PowerPoint, images, and plain text files.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate Multi-Page Documents">
Use the navigation controls at the bottom of the viewer to move between pages. You can also zoom in/out and rotate the document view.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Supported File Types">
The built-in document viewer supports most common file formats. If a file type is not supported for preview, you can download it to view in an external application.
</Callout>

## Using the Annotation Tools

Brightspace includes built-in annotation tools that allow you to mark up student submissions directly in the browser without external software.

<Callout type="warning" title="Turnitin Compatibility">
Do not use both Brightspace annotation tools and Turnitin GradeMark on the same assignment. Annotations made in one tool are not visible in the other, which can cause confusion for students.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Annotation Mode">
Click the **annotation (pen) icon** in the document viewer toolbar to activate annotation tools.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Your Tool">
The annotation toolbar provides several marking options:

- **Highlight**: Select text and apply colored highlighting
- **Strikethrough**: Mark text for deletion or revision
- **Underline**: Emphasize specific text
- **Pen/Drawing**: Freehand drawing anywhere on the document
- **Text**: Add typed comments directly on the document
- **Sticky Notes**: Add collapsible comment boxes that can be expanded
</Step>

<Step title="Customize Appearance">
For each annotation type, you can customize:
- Color selection
- Opacity level
- Line thickness (for pen tool)
- Font and size (for text tool)
</Step>

<Step title="Add Comments">
Click on any annotation to add an associated comment. Sticky notes are particularly useful for longer explanations that students can expand or collapse.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Moving and Resizing">
Text boxes, sticky notes, and drawings can be moved and resized after placement. Click on the annotation to select it, then drag to reposition or use the handles to resize.
</Callout>

## Providing Text Feedback

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the Feedback Panel">
On the right side of the evaluation screen, you will find the feedback panel with fields for overall feedback.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Written Feedback">
Use the **Feedback** text box to provide overall comments on the submission. The editor supports:
- Basic text formatting (bold, italic, underline)
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Links to external resources
</Step>

<Step title="Use the HTML Editor">
For more detailed feedback, click the expand icon to access the full HTML editor with additional formatting options.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Recording Audio/Video Feedback

Brightspace allows you to record personalized audio or video messages as feedback, which can be more engaging than written comments alone.

<Callout type="info" title="Recording Limits">
Audio recordings are limited to **1 minute** and video recordings to **3 minutes**. For longer explanations, consider breaking your feedback into multiple recordings or using the text feedback area.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Recording Options">
In the evaluation panel, look for the **microphone icon** (audio) or **camera icon** (video) in the feedback area.
</Step>

<Step title="Grant Permissions">
When prompted, allow Brightspace to access your microphone and/or webcam. This permission request will appear in your browser.
</Step>

<Step title="Record Your Message">
Click **New Recording** to start. Speak clearly and address the student by name when appropriate. Click **Stop Recording** when finished.
</Step>

<Step title="Review and Add">
Listen to or watch your recording before adding it. If you are not satisfied, click **New Recording** to try again. When ready, click **Add** to attach it to the feedback.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Title and Description">
Give your recording a descriptive title. Optionally add a description to provide context.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Captions">
Select **Automatically generate captions from audio** and choose the audio language. This improves accessibility for students.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Reusing Video Feedback">
If you have general feedback that applies to multiple students, you can reuse video recordings. Click the **File upload icon**, then **Video Note Search** to find and attach previously recorded messages.
</Callout>

## Entering Grades

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the Grade Field">
In the evaluation panel, find the **Grade** or **Score** field near the top of the feedback area.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter the Score">
Type the numeric grade based on the assignment's point value. If a rubric is attached, you can click **Rubric** to grade using the rubric criteria instead.
</Step>

<Step title="Grade with Rubric (Optional)">
If a rubric is attached:
1. Click the **Rubric** link or icon
2. Select the appropriate level for each criterion
3. Add criterion-specific feedback if desired

<Step title="Review Total">
Verify that the grade displayed matches your intended evaluation before proceeding.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Publishing Feedback

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Publication Option">

Click **Publish** to release the grade and feedback. The student will be able to view everything immediately.
</Step>

<Step title="Save as Draft">
Click **Save Draft** if you want to:

- Release all grades at once after grading all submissions
- Wait until a specific date to release results
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Next Submission">
After publishing or saving, use the navigation arrows to move to the next ungraded submission, or return to the submission list.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Bulk Publishing">
You can publish feedback for multiple students at once from the Submissions page. Select the students, then use the **Publish Feedback** option from the actions menu.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Retracting Feedback">
If you need to make changes after publishing, Brightspace allows you to retract feedback in bulk from the Submissions page. This feature was added in May 2025.

## Handling Late Submissions

### Understanding Date Types

Brightspace uses several date types for assignments:

| Date Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Start Date** | When students can first access the assignment |
| **Due Date** | The deadline for on-time submission |
| **End Date** | The final date submissions are accepted |

<Callout type="info" title="Late Submission Indicators">
Submissions made after the due date but before the end date are automatically marked as "late" in the submission list. You can see this indicator when viewing submissions.
</Callout>

### Granting Extensions with Special Access

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Assignment Settings">
Go to **Assignments**, find your assignment, click the dropdown arrow, and select **Edit Assignment**.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Special Access">
Navigate to the **Availability Dates & Conditions** tab and click **Manage Special Access**.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Students">
Click **Add Users to Special Access** and select the students who need an extension.
</Step>

<Step title="Set New Dates">
Enter the extended due date and/or end date for these students. You can also adjust the start date if needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Save Changes">
Click **Save** to apply the special access. Students with extensions will not be marked late if they submit before their extended deadline.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Preventing Late Submissions">
If you want to stop accepting submissions after the due date, set the **End Date** to the same date and time as the **Due Date**. You can then grant Special Access to students who need extensions.
</Callout>

### Applying Late Penalties

<Callout type="warning" title="Manual Process">
Brightspace does not have built-in automatic late penalty calculations. You must manually adjust grades for late submissions or use workarounds.
</Callout>

Options for handling late penalties:

1. **Manual Deduction**: Reduce the grade when entering scores for late submissions
2. **Formula Grade Item**: Create a calculated grade item in the gradebook that applies penalties based on days late
3. **Bonus Item**: Create a bonus grade item with negative values to deduct points

### Automatic Zero for Missing Submissions

Brightspace can automatically assign zeros to students who do not submit by the due date:

- This feature is configured in the Gradebook settings
- Students can still submit after receiving an automatic zero (if the assignment remains available)
- Instructors can manually override the zero when grading the late submission

## Viewing the Submission Log

To see a detailed history of all submissions for an assignment:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Assignment">
Go to **Activities** > **Assignments** and find your assignment.
</Step>

<Step title="Open Submission Log">
Click the dropdown arrow next to the assignment and select **Submission Log**.
</Step>

<Step title="Review History">
The log shows:
- Submission timestamps
- File names
- Whether submissions were on time or late
- Multiple submission attempts (if allowed)
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |

| Cannot see annotation tools | Ensure annotation tools were enabled when creating the assignment in Evaluation & Feedback settings |
| File won't preview | Download the file to view in external software; not all file types support in-browser preview |
| Feedback not visible to student | Check that you clicked **Publish**, not **Save Draft** |
| Audio/video won't record | Ensure browser has permission to access microphone/camera |
| Quick Eval is empty | Verify students have submitted; Quick Eval only shows pending work |
