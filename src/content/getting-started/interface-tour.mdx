# Interface Tour

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive visual tour of the Brightspace interface. Understanding the layout and navigation elements will help you work efficiently in the learning management system. After logging in, you will encounter several key interface areas that remain consistent throughout your Brightspace experience.

## Before You Begin

- You should be logged into your Brightspace account
- Have access to at least one course
- Use a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

## Main Interface Layout

The Brightspace interface is organized into three main areas that appear on most pages:

1. **Minibar**: The global navigation bar at the very top of every page
2. **Navbar (Navigation Bar)**: Course-specific navigation that appears below the minibar when inside a course
3. **Content Area**: The main workspace where content, tools, and widgets are displayed

<Callout type="info" title="Consistent Navigation">
No matter where you are in Brightspace, the minibar always remains visible at the top, allowing you to quickly access courses, notifications, and settings from any page.
</Callout>

## The Minibar (Top Navigation Bar)

The minibar is your primary navigation tool and appears at the top of every Brightspace page. It contains global features that work across all your courses.

### Minibar Components (Left to Right)

| Icon | Name | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| Institution Logo | Home Button | Returns you to your organization homepage from anywhere |
| Home Icon | My Home | Takes you to your personal Brightspace homepage |
| Waffle/Grid Icon | Course Selector | Opens a dropdown to access and switch between courses |
| Envelope Icon | Message Alerts | Shows instant messages and email notifications |
| Speech Bubble Icon | Subscription Alerts | Displays updates from discussions you follow |
| Bell Icon | Update Alerts | Shows announcements, due dates, and grade notifications |
| Your Name/Avatar | Personal Menu | Access profile, settings, notifications, and logout |

<Callout type="tip" title="Red Notification Badges">
When you have unread notifications, a red circle with a number appears on the corresponding icon. This tells you at a glance how many items need your attention.
</Callout>

### Understanding the Minibar Icons

<Steps>
<Step title="Home Button (Institution Logo or Home Icon)">
The home icon (house symbol) or your institution's logo in the top-left corner serves as your "return to base" button. Click it from any page to return to your main Brightspace homepage.
</Step>

<Step title="Course Selector (Waffle Icon)">
The waffle icon (grid of nine squares) opens your course selector. This is one of the most frequently used navigation tools because it allows you to:
- View all courses you are enrolled in
- Search for specific courses by name or code
- Pin frequently used courses to the top of the list
- Sort courses by name or last accessed date
</Step>

<Step title="Message Alerts (Envelope Icon)">
Click the envelope to see instant messages from other Brightspace users. A red badge indicates unread messages. You can also access the email tool from this menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Subscription Alerts (Speech Bubble Icon)">
This shows notifications for discussion forums, topics, and threads you have subscribed to. Subscribing to a discussion means you want to be notified when new posts are added.
</Step>

<Step title="Update Alerts (Bell Icon)">
The bell icon displays important course updates including:
- New announcements from instructors
- Upcoming assignment due dates
- New grades posted
- Calendar events
</Step>

<Step title="Personal Menu (Your Name)">
Click on your name or profile picture to access:
- Profile settings (update your photo and display name)
- Notification preferences
- Account settings (time zone, language, number formats)
- View as Student option (for instructors)
- Logout
</Step>
</Steps>

## Course Selector

The course selector is essential for navigating between your courses efficiently.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Course Selector">
Click the waffle icon (grid icon) in the minibar to open the course selector dropdown panel.
</Step>

<Step title="Browse Your Courses">
You will see a list of all courses you have access to. The list can be sorted by:
- **Course name** (alphabetical order)
- **Last accessed** (most recently visited courses first)
</Step>

<Step title="Search for a Course">
If you have many courses, use the search box at the top of the dropdown. Type the course name or course code to quickly find what you need.
</Step>

<Step title="Pin Important Courses">
Click the pin icon next to any course to pin it. Pinned courses always appear at the top of your course list, making them easy to find regardless of how you sort the list.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to a Course">
Click on any course name to go directly to that course's homepage.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Course Access">
When viewing any page within a course, you can click the course name displayed in the minibar to instantly return to that course's homepage.
</Callout>

## My Home vs Course Home

Understanding the difference between these two "home" pages is important:

### My Home (Personal Homepage)

**My Home** is your personal Brightspace landing page that you see immediately after logging in. It provides:

- **My Courses widget**: A list of all courses you are enrolled in or teaching
- **Announcements widget**: Institution-wide announcements and Brightspace updates
- **Calendar widget**: Upcoming events and deadlines across all your courses
- **Quick access**: Links to tools that work across all courses

Think of My Home as your personal dashboard for your entire Brightspace experience.

### Course Home (Course Homepage)

**Course Home** is the landing page for a specific course. When you click on a course name, you are taken to its Course Home. It displays:

- **Course-specific announcements**: Updates from the instructor for that course only
- **Visual Table of Contents**: Overview of course modules and your progress
- **Course banner**: Customizable image identifying the course
- **Widgets**: Calendar, content browser, and other tools specific to that course

Think of Course Home as the front door to an individual course, customized by the instructor.

<Callout type="info" title="Navigation Tip">
Click the home icon in the minibar to return to **My Home** (personal dashboard). Click a course name in the minibar to return to that **Course Home** (course landing page).
</Callout>

## Content Area Layout

The content area is the large central workspace where you interact with course materials, tools, and features. Its layout changes depending on what you are viewing:

### Widget-Based Layout (Homepages)

Both My Home and Course Home typically use a widget-based layout:

- **Panels**: The page is divided into one, two, or three columns
- **Widgets**: Content blocks that display information (Announcements, Calendar, Course List, etc.)
- **Customizable**: Instructors can add, remove, and rearrange widgets

### Tool-Based Layout (Within Tools)

When you enter a specific tool (like Content, Assignments, or Gradebook):

- **Tool Header**: Shows the tool name and navigation breadcrumbs
- **Action Bar**: Contains buttons for creating, managing, and filtering items
- **Content List**: Displays items in that tool (modules, assignments, grades, etc.)
- **Detail Panel**: Shows detailed information when you select an item

## Widgets and Dashboard

Widgets are the building blocks of Brightspace homepages. They provide quick access to information and tools.

### Common System Widgets

| Widget | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Announcements** | Displays recent announcements from courses or institution |
| **Calendar** | Shows upcoming events, due dates, and deadlines |
| **My Courses** | Lists all courses you can access |

### Custom Widgets

Instructors can create custom widgets containing:
- Welcome messages
- Instructor contact information
- Quick links to resources
- Office hours information
- Course-specific announcements

<Callout type="tip" title="Collapsing Widgets">
Most widgets can be collapsed by clicking the minimize icon. This helps you focus on the most important information while keeping other widgets accessible.
</Callout>

## Navigation Menu (Course Navbar)

When you enter a course, a course-specific navigation bar appears below the minibar. This navbar contains links to all the tools available in that course.

### Standard Navbar Tools

Most course navbars include these common tools (though they may be customized):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Course Home** | Return to the course landing page |
| **Content** | Access modules, lessons, and course materials |
| **Assignments** | View and submit assignments |
| **Quizzes** | Take quizzes and view results |
| **Discussions** | Participate in course discussions |
| **Grades** | View your gradebook and feedback |
| **Calendar** | Course-specific events and deadlines |
| **Classlist** | View enrolled students and groups |

### Dropdown Menus

Many navbars group related tools into dropdown menus:

- **Activities**: Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions, Surveys
- **Assessment**: Grades, Rubrics, Competencies
- **Communication**: Announcements, Email, Calendar

<Callout type="warning" title="Navbar Variations">
The exact tools and organization of your navbar may differ between courses and institutions. Instructors can customize navbars, and some tools may be hidden if not used in a particular course.
</Callout>
