# Navigating the Navbar and Tools

## Overview

Brightspace uses two main navigation elements that appear on every page: the **Minibar** (top-right area) and the **Course Navbar** (below the minibar within courses). Understanding these navigation tools is essential for efficiently managing your courses and accessing the features you need.

## Before You Begin

- You should be logged into your Brightspace account
- Basic familiarity with web browser navigation is helpful
- Access to at least one course in Brightspace

## The Two Navigation Bars

Brightspace displays two navigation bars on all course pages:

1. **Minibar**: The global navigation bar at the very top of every page
2. **Course Navbar**: The course-specific navigation bar that appears below the minibar when inside a course

No matter what part of a course you are viewing, both navigation bars remain visible, allowing you to quickly access both course-specific and institution-wide tools.

## The Minibar (Top Navigation)

The minibar appears at the top of every Brightspace page and provides access to global features. It contains several key components:

### Minibar Components

| Icon/Element | Name | Function |
|-------------|------|----------|
| Home icon | My Home | Returns you to your main Brightspace homepage |
| Waffle/Grid icon | Course Selector | Shows all your courses and allows quick switching |
| Envelope icon | Message Alerts | Notifications about instant messages |
| Speech bubble icon | Subscription Alerts | Updates on discussion forums and blog posts |
| Bell icon | Update Alerts | Announcements, due dates, and grade notifications |
| Your name/avatar | Personal Menu | Profile settings, notifications, and logout |

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Navigation">
When viewing any page within a course, click the course name in the minibar to instantly return to that course's homepage.
</Callout>

### Using the Course Selector

The Course Selector (waffle/grid icon) is one of the most useful navigation tools:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Course Selector">
Click the waffle or grid icon in the minibar to open the course selector dropdown.
</Step>

<Step title="View your courses">
You will see a list of all courses you have access to. Courses can be sorted by:
- Course name (alphabetical)
- Date last accessed (most recent first)
</Step>

<Step title="Search for a course">
If you have many courses, use the search box at the top of the dropdown to quickly find a specific course by name or code.
</Step>

<Step title="Pin frequently used courses">
Click the pin icon next to any course to pin it to the top of your course list. Pinned courses appear first, making them easy to access regardless of sorting.
</Step>

<Step title="Access the course">
Click on any course name to navigate directly to that course's homepage.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding Notification Alerts

The minibar displays three types of notification alerts, each indicated by a specific icon:

**Message Alerts (Envelope)**
- Notifications about instant messages from other users
- A red circle appears when you have unread messages

**Subscription Alerts (Speech Bubble)**
- Updates about new posts in discussion forums you follow
- Blog post notifications
- New thread activity

**Update Alerts (Bell)**
- New and updated announcements
- Upcoming due dates and end dates
- New grades posted

<Callout type="info" title="Notification Indicator">
When you have unread notifications, a red circle with a number appears on the corresponding icon showing how many items need your attention.
</Callout>

### Personal Menu

Click on your name or profile picture in the top-right corner to access:

- **Profile**: Update your display name and profile picture
- **Notification Options**: Configure how and when you receive notifications
- **Account Settings**: Adjust time zone, language, and other preferences
- **Logout**: Sign out of Brightspace

## The Course Navbar

When you enter a course, the Course Navbar appears below the minibar. This navigation bar contains links to all the tools available within that specific course.

### Standard Navbar Links

Most course navbars include these common tools (though your institution may customize these):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Course Home** | Return to the course landing page |
| **Content** | Access modules, lessons, and course materials |
| **Assignments** | View and submit assignments (Dropbox) |
| **Quizzes** | Take quizzes and view results |
| **Discussions** | Participate in course discussions |
| **Grades** | View your gradebook and feedback |
| **Calendar** | See due dates and course events |
| **Classlist** | View enrolled students and groups |

<Callout type="warning" title="Navbar Variations">
The exact links on your navbar may differ based on your institution's configuration and what tools your instructor has enabled. Some tools may be grouped under dropdown menus like "Activities" or "Assessment."
</Callout>

### Navbar Dropdown Menus

Many navbars organize related tools into dropdown menus to keep the navigation clean:

**Activities Menu** (common groupings):
- Assignments

## Mobile Navigation Differences

When accessing Brightspace on mobile devices, the navigation experience differs from desktop:

### Browser on Mobile

When using Brightspace through a mobile web browser:
- The minibar remains at the top but may collapse into a menu icon
- The course navbar may become a hamburger menu (three horizontal lines)
- Tap the menu icon to access navigation options
- Some interface elements are optimized for touch interaction

### Brightspace Pulse App

The Brightspace Pulse mobile app has a different navigation structure:

**What Pulse Offers:**
- Quick access to announcements and notifications
- View upcoming due dates and calendar
- Check grades
- Access course content (limited file types)
- Read and reply to discussions

**Pulse Limitations:**
- Cannot take quizzes or exams
- Limited assignment submission capabilities
- Cannot subscribe/unsubscribe to discussion threads
- Fewer formatting options for replies
- Some features open in a browser window

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice for Mobile">
Use the Pulse app for quick checks on grades, announcements, and due dates. For submitting assignments, taking quizzes, or complex course interactions, use the full web interface in a browser.
</Callout>

## Common Navigation Issues

### "I can't find a tool in my navbar"

- Check dropdown menus - the tool may be grouped under Activities, Assessment, or Communication
