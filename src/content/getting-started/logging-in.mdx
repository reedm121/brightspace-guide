# Logging In to Brightspace

## Overview

This guide covers how to access your Brightspace account, troubleshoot common login issues, and configure your account settings.

## Before You Begin

- You need your institution credentials (username/email and password)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge recommended)
- A stable internet connection

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your institution's Brightspace URL">
Open your web browser and go to your institution's Brightspace login page. This is typically in the format: `https://[institution].brightspace.com`

Your institution may also have a direct link from their main website or student/faculty portal.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter your credentials">
On the login page:
1. Enter your username or institutional email address
2. Enter your password
3. Click the **Log In** button

Some institutions use Single Sign-On (SSO), which may redirect you to a separate authentication page.
</Step>

<Step title="Complete any additional authentication">
If your institution uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
1. Check your phone or email for the verification code
2. Enter the code when prompted
3. Click **Verify** or **Submit**
</Step>

<Step title="Access your courses">
Once logged in, you'll see your homepage with a list of your courses. Click on any course name to enter that course's Brightspace environment.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Password Issues">
If you've forgotten your password, use your institution's password reset process, not Brightspace's. Brightspace uses your institutional credentials.
</Callout>

## Common Issues

### "Invalid username or password"
- Verify you're using the correct username format (some institutions use email, others use a student/employee ID)
- Check that Caps Lock is not enabled
- Try resetting your password through your institution's portal

### "Your session has expired"
- This occurs after a period of inactivity
- Simply log in again to continue
- Consider enabling "Remember me" if available

### Browser compatibility issues
- Clear your browser cache and cookies
- Try an incognito/private browsing window
- Update your browser to the latest version
- Try a different browser

<Callout type="tip" title="Bookmark Your Login Page">
Save your institution's Brightspace URL as a bookmark for quick access in the future.

## Account Settings

After logging in, you can configure your account:

1. Click on your **profile icon** in the top-right corner
2. Select **Account Settings**
3. Here you can:
   - Update your display name
   - Change notification preferences
   - Set your time zone
   - Configure email forwarding

## Mobile Access

Brightspace offers a mobile app called **Brightspace Pulse**:
- Available for iOS and Android
- Provides quick access to grades, assignments, and announcements
- Download from your device's app store

<Callout type="info">
The mobile app provides a streamlined experience but doesn't include all features available on the web version. Use the full web interface for course setup and grading.
