# Understanding the Course Homepage

## Overview

The course homepage is the first page students see when they enter your Brightspace course. It serves as a central hub that provides quick access to important course information, announcements, upcoming deadlines, and course content. By default, Brightspace uses a widget-based layout that you can customize to create an engaging and informative landing page for your students.

## Before You Begin

- You must have instructor or designer access to your course
- Ensure your course is set up with at least some basic content
- Familiarize yourself with the basic Brightspace navigation

<Callout type="info" title="Default Homepage">
All courses start with a default course homepage that includes the Visual Table of Contents and Announcements widgets. You cannot edit the default homepage directly, but you can create a copy and customize it.
</Callout>

## What Are Widgets?

Widgets are content blocks that display on your course homepage. Think of them as building blocks that provide information and quick access to tools, content, and course features. There are two types of widgets:

- **System Widgets**: Pre-built widgets provided by Brightspace (Announcements, Calendar, Content Browser, etc.). You cannot modify their core functionality, but you can customize their display options.
- **Custom Widgets**: Widgets you create using HTML to display custom content like instructor information, course resources, or welcome messages.

## Default Widgets

Most Brightspace courses come with these commonly used widgets:

### Visual Table of Contents (TOC)
Displays module titles, images, descriptions, and progress indicators. It provides students with a visual overview of course content and direct links to modules.

### Announcements Widget
Shows recent course announcements. You can customize how many announcements display and how long they remain visible.

### Calendar/Upcoming Events Widget
Displays upcoming deadlines, events, and activities for the course. Helps students stay on track with due dates.

### Content Browser Widget
Allows students to browse course content, view recently visited topics, and access bookmarked items directly from the homepage.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Creating a Custom Homepage

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Homepages tool">
From your course, click **Course Admin** in the navbar. Under the Site Setup section, click **Homepages**.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new homepage">
Click the **Create Homepage** button. Enter a descriptive name for your homepage (for example, "Fall 2025 Homepage" or your course name).
</Step>

<Step title="Choose your layout">
Click **Change Layout** to select a panel configuration. The recommended layout is **Large Left Panel** or **Two Panel** which displays well on both desktop and mobile devices.

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid Three Equal Panels">
Do not use the "Three Equal Panels" layout as it does not display well on mobile devices, which many students use to access courses.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Add widgets to your homepage">
Click **Add Widgets** at the bottom of each panel section. Select the widgets you want to include by checking the boxes, then click **Add**. Common choices include:
- Visual Table of Contents
- Announcements
- Calendar
- Content Browser
- Updates (Activity Feed)
</Step>

<Step title="Arrange your widgets">
Drag and drop widgets to reorder them vertically or move them between panels. Place the most important information (like Announcements) in prominent positions.
</Step>

<Step title="Save and activate">
Click **Save and Close**. Return to the Homepages list, then select your new homepage from the **Active Homepage** dropdown and click **Apply**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Customizing Widget Display

<Steps>
<Step title="Access widget options">
On your course homepage, hover over a widget and click the dropdown arrow or three-dot menu next to the widget title.
</Step>

<Step title="Style the widget">
If you see **Style this Widget**, you can:
- Hide the widget title bar
- Allow students to minimize the widget
- Change the widget title to a custom name
</Step>

<Step title="Configure widget settings">
If you see **Customize this Widget**, you can adjust widget-specific settings. For example, in the Announcements widget, you can set:
- Maximum number of announcements to display
- Number of days before announcements are automatically removed
</Step>
</Steps>

### Changing Your Course Banner Image

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the banner image">
On your course homepage, hover over the course banner image at the top of the page.
</Step>

Click the three-dot menu (Action Menu) that appears in the upper right corner of the banner and select **Change Image**.
</Step>

<Step title="Upload or select an image">
You can either:
- Select an existing image from the course image library
- Click **Upload** to add your own custom banner image

<Callout type="tip" title="Recommended Image Size">
For best results, use an image that is 1200 x 300 pixels or 2400 x 960 pixels. Wide images work best as tall or square images will be significantly cropped.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Customize banner text (optional)">
Click the three-dot menu again and select **Customize Banner Text** to change the text displayed over your banner image. Select **Custom** and enter your preferred text.

## Viewing Your Course as a Student

It is important to check how your homepage appears to students. Brightspace provides a "View as Student" feature for this purpose.

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter student view">
Click on your name in the top-right minibar, then select **View as Student** (or **View as Learner** depending on your institution).
</Step>

<Step title="Review the student experience">
Navigate through your course homepage and content. You will see a double-arrow icon indicating you are in student view. Notice that:
- Editing tools are hidden
- Only visible content is shown
- Hidden items are not displayed
</Step>

<Step title="Exit student view">
Click on your name in the minibar and select the X button or **Exit Student View** to return to your instructor view.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Limitations of Student View">
While student view shows what students see, you cannot actually submit assignments or complete quizzes in this mode. Use the Preview function within quizzes to test quiz functionality.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

- **Keep it simple**: Too many widgets can overwhelm students and hide important information
- **Prioritize announcements**: Place the Announcements widget prominently so students see important updates
- **Use consistent naming**: Name your homepages by semester or term for easy management
- **Choose a responsive layout**: Stick to one or two-panel layouts for better mobile compatibility
- **Update your banner**: A custom course image helps students quickly identify your course
- **Test on mobile**: Many students access Brightspace on phones and tablets

<Callout type="tip" title="Widget Recommendations">
For most courses, focus on these essential widgets: Announcements, Visual Table of Contents or Content Browser, and Calendar/Upcoming Events. Add additional widgets only if they provide clear value to students.
</Callout>

## Common Issues

### Cannot edit the default homepage
The default homepage is locked. Create a copy of it or create a new homepage, customize it, then set it as the active homepage.

### "Edit this homepage" option is missing
Verify that:
- You have a widget-based homepage (not a Tool or External URL type)
- You have the necessary permissions (Manage Homepages)
- You are looking at a homepage you created, not the system default

### Widgets not appearing correctly
- Check that the widget is properly added to the active homepage
- Verify the widget has not been minimized
- Try a different browser or clear your cache

### Course image not displaying
- Ensure your image is in JPG or GIF format (PNG may not work at some institutions)
- Check that the image meets size requirements
- Try uploading a different image
