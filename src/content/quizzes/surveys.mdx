# Surveys

## Overview

**Surveys** in Brightspace allow you to collect feedback from students without affecting their grades. Unlike quizzes, surveys are designed for gathering opinions, conducting course evaluations, collecting pre/post assessments, or polling students on topics. Surveys can be anonymous or identified, and results can be viewed in aggregate or individually.

<Callout type="info" title="Surveys vs Quizzes">
Surveys use a similar interface to quizzes but are fundamentally different: they don't have correct answers, aren't graded, and are designed for feedback collection rather than assessment.
</Callout>

## Why Use Surveys?

Surveys serve many purposes in online courses:

| Purpose | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Course Feedback** | Gather mid-term or end-of-course evaluations |
| **Needs Assessment** | Learn about student backgrounds and preferences |
| **Pre/Post Assessment** | Measure attitude or knowledge changes over time |
| **Topic Polling** | Let students vote on discussion topics or project options |
| **Check-Ins** | Monitor student wellbeing or course satisfaction |
| **Research** | Collect data for educational research (with IRB approval) |

<Callout type="tip" title="Mid-Semester Feedback">
Don't wait until the end of the course to gather feedback. Mid-semester surveys let you make adjustments while you can still help current students.
</Callout>

## Accessing Surveys

To access the Surveys tool:

1. From your course navbar, click **Surveys** (may be under **Activities** or **Tools**)
2. If not in the navbar, go to **Course Admin** and look for **Surveys**
3. You'll see a list of existing surveys and options to create new ones

### Likert Scale Questions

Likert scales are ideal for measuring attitudes and opinions:

**Example question**: "The course materials are helpful for my learning."

| Option | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Strongly Agree | 5 |
| Agree | 4 |
| Neutral | 3 |
| Disagree | 2 |
| Strongly Disagree | 1 |

<Callout type="tip" title="Consistent Scales">
Use the same scale direction throughout your survey. If "5" means "Strongly Agree" for one question, keep it consistent for all Likert questions.
</Callout>

## Organizing Survey Questions

### Using Sections

Group related questions into sections:

1. Click **Add Section** or **New Section**
2. Give the section a title (e.g., "Course Content" or "Instructor Feedback")
3. Add questions within each section
4. Add section descriptions to provide context

### Page Breaks

Control how questions are displayed:

- **Single page**: All questions visible at once
- **Multiple pages**: Break survey into pages for longer surveys
- **One question per page**: Maximum focus on each question

## Survey Settings

### Submission Settings

Configure how students interact with the survey:

- **Attempts allowed**: Usually 1 for surveys (vs multiple for practice quizzes)
- **Show questions one at a time**: Focus students on individual questions
- **Shuffle questions**: Randomize question order to reduce bias

### Results Display

Control what students see after submitting:

- **Thank you message**: Custom text shown after submission
- **Show summary**: Allow students to see aggregate results
- **Hide results**: Keep all responses private

<Callout type="info" title="Transparency">
Consider sharing aggregate results with students after the survey closes. This shows you value their input and builds trust.
</Callout>

## Anonymous vs. Identified Surveys

### Anonymous Surveys

**Advantages:**
- Students may be more honest
- Better for sensitive topics
- Appropriate for course evaluations

**Limitations:**
- Can't follow up with individual students
- Can't verify who has/hasn't responded (for completion tracking)
- May get less thoughtful responses

**Best for:** Course evaluations, sensitive feedback, controversial topics

### Identified Surveys

**Advantages:**
- Can follow up on concerning responses
- Know who has completed the survey
- Can use completion as a release condition

**Limitations:**
- Students may self-censor
- Not appropriate for sensitive topics

**Best for:** Needs assessments, preference surveys, check-ins where follow-up may be needed

## Viewing Survey Results

### Accessing Results

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Survey">
Navigate to **Surveys** and click on the survey you want to review.
</Step>

<Step title="View Statistics">
Click **Statistics** or **Results** to see response data.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Aggregate Data">
For each question, you'll see:
- Response distribution (how many chose each option)
- Percentages
- Charts/graphs (for visual representation)
- For text questions: list of written responses
</Step>
</Steps>

### Analyzing Results

**For rating scales:**
- Look at mean (average) scores
- Check the distribution—are responses clustered or spread out?
- Compare across sections or time periods

**For open-ended questions:**
- Read all responses
- Look for common themes
- Note both positive feedback and areas for improvement
- Consider using word clouds for visualization

### Exporting Survey Data

Export results for deeper analysis:

1. Open survey results
2. Click **Export** or **Download**
3. Choose format (CSV, Excel, PDF)
4. Import into your preferred analysis tool

## Using Surveys with Release Conditions

### Survey Completion as a Condition

Use identified survey completion to unlock content:

1. Create an identified survey
2. On the content you want to control, add a release condition
3. Select "Survey completed" as the condition
4. Choose the survey
5. Content unlocks when students submit the survey

**Example uses:**
- Require students to complete a background survey before accessing course content
- Unlock feedback on their responses after survey submission

<Callout type="warning" title="Anonymous Survey Limitation">
You cannot use anonymous survey completion as a release condition because the system doesn't track individual submissions.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### Survey Design

- **Keep it short**: Respect students' time (10-15 questions max for regular surveys)
- **Use clear language**: Avoid jargon or ambiguous wording
- **One question per question**: Don't combine multiple concepts
- **Include open-ended options**: Let students elaborate on ratings
- **Test your survey**: Preview it before releasing to students

### Timing

- **Give adequate time**: At least 3-5 days for completion
- **Send reminders**: Announce surveys and send follow-ups
- **Choose strategic timing**: Not during exam weeks or high-stress periods
- **Consider multiple touchpoints**: Beginning, middle, and end of course

### Acting on Feedback

- **Acknowledge receipt**: Thank students for their input
- **Share what you learned**: Tell students about common themes
- **Explain changes**: Show how feedback influenced course adjustments
- **Be honest about limitations**: Explain what can't change and why

<Callout type="tip" title="Close the Loop">
Students are more likely to provide thoughtful feedback in the future if they see their input made a difference. Always follow up on survey results.
</Callout>
