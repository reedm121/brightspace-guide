# Creating Quizzes

## Overview

Brightspace's Quiz tool allows you to create tests, exams, and assessments with various question types. This guide covers the complete process of creating a quiz, from initial setup through configuration of timing, attempts, and gradebook integration.

## Before You Begin

- You need **Instructor** or **Teaching Assistant** permissions in the course
- Decide whether your quiz will be graded and contribute to the final grade
- Consider whether you want to build questions directly or import from the Question Library
- Plan your quiz settings: time limits, attempts allowed, availability dates

<Callout type="info" title="New Quiz Creation Experience">
As of July 2023, Brightspace uses the **New Quiz Creation Experience** exclusively. The interface now resembles the Assignments tool, with settings panels on the right side of the screen instead of tabs at the top.
</Callout>

## Creating a New Quiz

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the Quizzes tool">
From your course navbar, click **Assessments** and select **Quizzes** from the dropdown menu.

You will see a list of any existing quizzes in your course.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new quiz">
Click the **New Quiz** button at the top of the page.

The quiz creation screen will open with:
- A main editing area on the left for your quiz name, instructions, and questions
- Settings panels on the right side for configuration options
</Step>

<Step title="Enter quiz name and basic information">
1. Enter a descriptive **Name** for your quiz (e.g., "Chapter 3 Quiz" or "Midterm Exam")
2. In the **Grade Out Of** field, enter the total points for the quiz
3. Add **Instructions** in the rich text editor to explain expectations, allowed materials, or special instructions for students
</Step>

<Step title="Configure gradebook connection">
By default, new quizzes show **In Grade Book** which automatically creates a grade item.

Click the dropdown to change this:
- **In Grade Book** (default) - Creates a new grade item automatically
- **Edit or Link to Existing** - Connect to a grade item you already created
- **Not in Grade Book** - Use for practice quizzes or ungraded assessments

<Callout type="tip" title="Grade Synchronization">
When connected to the gradebook, ensure "Automatically update evaluations in grade book when published" is enabled in the Assessment settings. This pushes quiz scores to the gradebook automatically.
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Questions to Your Quiz

You have two options for adding questions: creating them directly in the quiz or importing from the Question Library.

### Adding Questions Directly

<Steps>
<Step title="Click Add/Edit Questions">
In the quiz editing area, click **Add/Edit Questions** to enter the question editor.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new question">
Click **New** and select your question type:
- **Multiple Choice** - Students select one correct answer
- **Multi-Select** - Students select multiple correct answers
- **True/False** - Binary choice questions
- **Written Response** - Short answer or essay questions
- **Fill in the Blanks** - Students complete missing words
- **Matching** - Connect items from two columns
- **Ordering** - Arrange items in correct sequence
- **Arithmetic** - Math problems with calculated answers
- **Significant Figures** - Scientific notation questions
</Step>

<Step title="Configure question settings">
1. Enter the question text in the rich text editor
2. Add answer options (for multiple choice/matching)
3. Mark the correct answer(s)
4. Set the **Points** value for the question
5. Optionally add **Feedback** for correct/incorrect responses
6. Click **Save** when finished
</Step>

<Step title="Add more questions">
Repeat the process to add additional questions. Click **Done Editing Questions** when finished.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Importing Questions from the Question Library

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
Building questions in the Question Library first allows you to reuse them across multiple quizzes and enables randomization through question pools.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Access import options">
In the question editor, click **Add Existing** and select **Browse Question Library**.
</Step>

<Step title="Select questions to import">
1. Navigate to the section/folder containing your questions
2. Check the boxes next to questions you want to import
3. Click **Import** to add them to your quiz
</Step>

<Step title="Create a question pool (optional)">
For randomized questions:
1. Click **New** and select **Question Pool**
2. Name the pool and click **Browse Question Library**
3. Select the section containing your questions
4. Click **Import**
5. Set the **Number of Questions to Select** (e.g., "5 out of 20")

This randomly selects a subset of questions for each student.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Copying Quizzes with Pools">
When copying quizzes containing question pools to another course, always copy the entire Question Library as well. Otherwise, questions become "orphaned" and cannot be edited or reused properly.
</Callout>

## Quiz Timing Settings

Configure time limits in the **Timing & Display** section on the right panel.

### Time Limit Options

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **No Time Limit** | Students can take as long as needed |
| **Recommended Time Limit** | Guides students but does not enforce |
| **Enforced Time Limit** | Strict limit with consequences for exceeding |

### Enforced Time Limit Behavior

When an enforced time limit expires, choose what happens:

1. **Automatically submit the quiz attempt** (Default) - The quiz submits when time runs out, preventing further changes
2. **Flag as "exceeded time limit" and allow continued work** - Students can continue, but you see they went over time
3. **Do nothing** - Functions as a recommended limit only

### Grace Period

Enable a grace period to give students extra time after the enforced limit to finish their current question or review before automatic submission.

<Callout type="info" title="Synchronous vs Asynchronous">
Choose whether students take the quiz on their own time (asynchronously) or together at a designated time (synchronously). This affects how timing is displayed and managed.
</Callout>

## Availability Dates

Set when students can access the quiz in the **Availability Dates & Conditions** section.

<Steps>
<Step title="Set Start Date">
The **Start Date** determines when students can enter and begin the quiz. Before this date, students can see the quiz exists but cannot start it.
</Step>

<Step title="Set End Date">
The **End Date** is when the quiz closes completely. After this date, students cannot access the quiz at all.

<Callout type="warning" title="End Date vs Due Date">
The **End Date** overrides the **Due Date**. If your end date is before your due date, students will lose access before the assignment is technically "due."
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Set Due Date (optional)">
The **Due Date** indicates when the quiz should be completed but does not prevent access. It appears on the course calendar and helps students plan.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Attempt Limits

Configure in the **Attempts & Completion** section.

<Steps>
<Step title="Set attempts allowed">
Click **Manage Attempts** and select from the dropdown:
- **1 attempt** (default for most exams)
- **2-10 attempts** (for practice quizzes)
- **Unlimited** (for self-paced learning)
</Step>

<Step title="Configure grade calculation for multiple attempts">
When allowing multiple attempts, choose how the final grade is calculated:
- **Highest Attempt** - Best score counts
- **Lowest Attempt** - Worst score counts
- **Average of All Attempts** - Mean score
- **First Attempt** - Only initial attempt counts
- **Last Attempt** (default) - Most recent attempt counts
</Step>

<Step title="Enable retake incorrect only (optional)">
Check **Retake Incorrect Questions Only** to allow students to only re-answer questions they got wrong on subsequent attempts.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Randomization Options

Shuffle questions to reduce cheating and create varied quiz experiences.

In the **Timing & Display** section:

1. Enable **Shuffle Quiz** to randomize the order of questions for each student
2. Within individual questions, you can also shuffle answer options

<Callout type="tip" title="Question Pools for True Randomization">
For maximum variety, use Question Pools to randomly select different questions for each student from a larger bank, not just shuffle the same questions in different orders.
</Callout>

## Password Protection

Add a password requirement in the **Availability Dates & Conditions** section.

1. Find the **Password** field
2. Enter your chosen password
3. Students must enter this password exactly (case-sensitive) to access the quiz

<Callout type="info" title="Common Use Case">
Instructors typically display the password in the classroom when administering in-person proctored exams, ensuring students are physically present.
</Callout>

## Special Access

Grant specific students different settings (accommodations, extensions).

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Special Access settings">
In the **Availability Dates & Conditions** section, click **Special Access**.
</Step>

<Step title="Add users">
Click **Add Users to Special Access** and select the students who need accommodations.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure individual settings">
For each student, you can override:
- Start/End/Due dates
- Time limit (extended time)
- Number of attempts allowed
</Step>
</Steps>

## Previewing and Testing Your Quiz

<Callout type="warning" title="Always Preview">
Always preview your quiz before making it available to students. Test the accuracy of content, question display, and auto-grading.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Access quiz preview">
From the Quizzes list, click the dropdown arrow next to your quiz name and select **Preview**.

Alternatively, while editing the quiz, click the **Preview** button.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure preview options">
Choose whether to enable **Bypass Restrictions** to ignore time limits and availability dates during preview, or uncheck it to experience the quiz exactly as students will.
</Step>

<Step title="Complete the preview">
1. Click **Start Quiz!**
2. Answer the questions as a student would
3. Submit the quiz
4. Review the auto-grading and feedback
5. Click **Exit Preview** to return to quiz management
</Step>

<Step title="Make adjustments">
Based on your preview, edit questions, adjust settings, or fix any issues before releasing the quiz to students.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Publishing Your Quiz

New quizzes are visible to students by default once saved. To control visibility:

1. Toggle the **Visibility** setting in the quiz properties
2. Set appropriate **Start Date** to control when students can access it
3. Use **Release Conditions** for more complex availability rules

<Callout type="info" title="Auto-Publish Results">
By default, quiz attempt results automatically publish to learners and the gradebook. Disable this in the Assessment settings if you want to review results before students see their scores.
</Callout>

## Common Issues

### Quiz not appearing in gradebook
- Verify the quiz is set to "In Grade Book" not "Not in Grade Book"
- Check that "Automatically update evaluations in grade book when published" is enabled
- Confirm the grade item visibility dates include the current date

### Students cannot access the quiz
- Check the Start Date has passed
- Verify the End Date has not passed
- Confirm the quiz visibility is turned on
- Check for any Release Conditions that may be blocking access

### Time limit not working as expected
- Ensure you selected "Enforced Time Limit" not "Recommended"
- Check the "When time limit expires" setting matches your intention
- Verify no Special Access overrides are in place
