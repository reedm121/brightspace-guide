# Quiz Question Types

## Overview

Brightspace offers 12 different question types for building quizzes and assessments. Each question type serves a specific purpose, from simple true/false questions to complex arithmetic problems with variables. Understanding these question types helps you create effective assessments that accurately measure student learning.

<Callout type="info" title="Auto-Grading vs Manual Grading">
Most question types in Brightspace are auto-graded, meaning students receive immediate scores. Written Response and Likert questions require manual grading by the instructor.
</Callout>

## Before You Begin

- Access to the Question Library in your Brightspace course
- Understanding of your assessment goals
- Content prepared for your questions
- Point values determined for each question

---

## True/False Questions (T/F)

True/False questions present a statement that students must identify as correct or incorrect. These are ideal for testing factual knowledge and basic comprehension.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new True/False question">
Navigate to **Quizzes** from the course navbar, click the **Question Library** tab, select a folder, click **New**, and choose **True or False (T/F)**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter your question">
Type your statement in the **Question Text** field. Write clear, unambiguous statements that are definitively true or false.
</Step>

<Step title="Set the correct answer">
Select whether the statement is **True** or **False** as the correct answer.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure point value">
Enter the number of points this question is worth in the **Points** field.
</Step>

<Step title="Add feedback (optional)">
Click **Options** and select **Add Feedback** to provide explanations for both correct and incorrect responses.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
Avoid negative statements in True/False questions as they can confuse students. For example, use "The sky is blue" instead of "The sky is not green."
</Callout>

---

## Multiple Choice Questions (M/C)

Multiple Choice questions present a question or statement with several possible answers, where students select the single best answer. This is the most commonly used question type.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new Multiple Choice question">
In the Question Library, click **New** and select **Multiple Choice (M/C)**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter your question">
Type your question in the **Question Text** field. Be specific about what you are asking.
</Step>

<Step title="Add answer options">
Enter each possible answer in the **Value** fields. Click **Add Answer** to create additional options. A typical question has 4-5 choices.
</Step>

<Step title="Mark the correct answer">
Select the radio button next to the correct answer to indicate it as the right choice.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure scoring">
Set the point value for the question. You can also configure partial credit using **Custom Weight** to assign percentage values to answers.
</Step>

<Step title="Randomize answer order (optional)">
Select **Randomize answers** to shuffle the order of choices for each student, reducing the chance of cheating.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Partial Credit Options

Multiple choice questions support partial credit through **Custom Weight**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 100% | Fully correct answer |
| 50% | Partially correct answer |
| 0% | Incorrect answer |
| Negative % | Penalty for selecting wrong answer |

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid Common Pitfalls">
Do not use "All of the above" or "None of the above" when randomizing answers, as these options become confusing when moved to different positions.
</Callout>

---

## Multi-Select Questions (M-S)

Multi-Select questions require students to identify one or more correct answers from a list. Unlike Multiple Choice, students can select multiple options.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new Multi-Select question">
In the Question Library, click **New** and select **Multi-Select (M-S)**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter your question">
Type your question in the **Question Text** field. Clearly indicate that students should select all correct answers.
</Step>

<Step title="Add answer options">
Enter all possible answers in the **Value** fields. Mark each correct answer by checking the corresponding checkbox.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose a grading method">
Select your preferred grading approach from the available options.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Multi-Select Grading Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Right Minus Wrong** | Points for correct selections minus points for incorrect selections. Students cannot receive negative scores. |
| **Correct Selections** | Students receive points for each correct choice selected and each incorrect choice not selected. |
| **All or Nothing** | Students must select all correct answers and no incorrect answers to receive any points. |

<Callout type="info" title="Example">
For a 2-point question with 4 answer choices using "Right Minus Wrong": each selection is worth 0.5 points. If a student selects 2 correct answers and 1 incorrect answer, they receive 0.5 points (1 - 0.5 = 0.5).
</Callout>
