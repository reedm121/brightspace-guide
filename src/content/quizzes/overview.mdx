# Quizzes

## What is the Quizzes Tool?

The **Quizzes** tool in Brightspace allows you to create online assessments—from low-stakes practice quizzes to high-stakes proctored exams. Quizzes can include a variety of question types, automatic grading for objective questions, and flexible settings to control the testing experience.

Whether you're assessing reading comprehension, testing mastery of concepts, or administering final exams, the Quizzes tool provides the features you need.

## Why Use Quizzes?

Online quizzes offer several advantages over paper-based testing:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Instant Feedback** | Auto-graded questions give students immediate results |
| **Time Savings** | Objective questions grade themselves automatically |
| **Flexibility** | Students can take quizzes anytime within your availability window |
| **Question Pools** | Randomize questions so each student gets a different version |
| **Detailed Analytics** | See which questions students struggle with most |
| **Accessibility** | Built-in accommodations for extended time and other needs |

<Callout type="tip" title="Formative vs Summative">
Quizzes work well for both formative assessment (low-stakes practice to check understanding) and summative assessment (graded tests and exams). Consider allowing multiple attempts on formative quizzes to encourage learning.

## Best Practices

### Building Effective Quizzes
- Write clear, unambiguous questions
- Ensure all answer options are plausible (avoid obvious wrong answers)
- Test your quiz by previewing it before releasing to students
- Include point values that match the difficulty level

### Using Question Pools
- Create pools for randomized question selection
- Use pools to create unique quiz versions for academic integrity
- Tag questions by topic or learning objective for easy organization

### Setting Up Timing
- Allow slightly more time than you think students need
- Consider adding a grace period for technical issues
- Test how long the quiz takes by timing yourself

### Managing Results
- Don't show correct answers while the quiz is still available
- Use submission views to control feedback timing
- Review question statistics to identify problematic questions

## Common Questions

**Can students pause and resume a quiz?**
By default, yes—students can leave and return as long as they're within the availability window and time limit. You can change this in quiz settings.

**What happens if a student's internet disconnects?**
Their progress is saved. They can log back in and continue where they left off (assuming time remains).

**Can I give a student extra time?**
Yes, use Special Access to extend time limits or grant additional attempts for individual students.

**How do I prevent cheating?**
Use question randomization, answer shuffling, question pools, time limits, and consider proctoring software for high-stakes exams. No system is foolproof, but these measures help.

**Can students see the correct answers after submitting?**
Only if you configure the Submission View to show them. You control exactly what feedback students receive.
