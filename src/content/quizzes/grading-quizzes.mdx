# Grading Quizzes and Viewing Attempts

## Overview

After students complete quizzes in Brightspace, instructors need to review attempts, grade any manually-scored questions (such as written responses), provide feedback, and ensure grades sync correctly with the gradebook. This guide covers the complete workflow for managing quiz results, from viewing individual attempts to analyzing overall quiz performance.

## Before You Begin

- You must have **Manage Quizzes** or **Grade Quizzes** permissions in your course
- Understand which question types require manual grading (written response, short answer)
- Have a grading plan for providing feedback and adjusting scores if needed
- Know your institution's policies on regrading and allowing additional attempts

<Callout type="info" title="New Quiz Evaluation Experience">
As of April 2025, Brightspace introduced a new quiz evaluation experience that aligns the grading interface with Assignments and Discussions. This became the default interface in July 2025. The steps in this guide reflect this updated experience.
</Callout>

## Viewing Quiz Attempts Overview

Access student quiz attempts to see who has completed the quiz, their scores, and detailed submission information.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the Quizzes tool">
From your course navbar, go to **Assessments > Quizzes** (or **Activities > Quizzes** depending on your course setup).
</Step>

<Step title="Access the Grade view">
Find the quiz you want to grade. Click the **dropdown arrow** (chevron) next to the quiz name and select **Grade** from the menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the attempts list">
You will see a list of all student attempts with the following information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **User** | Student name |
| **Attempt** | Attempt number (1, 2, etc.) |
| **Score** | Points earned / total points |
| **Grade** | Percentage score |
| **Completion Date** | When the attempt was submitted |
| **Time Spent** | Duration of the attempt |
| **Status** | Graded, In Progress, or Needs Grading |
</Step>

<Step title="Filter and sort attempts">
Use the available filters to view specific attempts:

- **Attempts tab** - View all attempts across all users
- **Users tab** - View attempts organized by student
- **Status filter** - Show only attempts needing grading

Click column headers to sort by score, date, or other criteria.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Identifying Ungraded Attempts">
Quizzes containing written response questions will show "Needs Grading" status until all manual questions are scored. Use the status filter to quickly find attempts requiring your attention.
</Callout>

## Grading Written Response Questions

Written response, short answer, and essay questions require manual grading since they cannot be auto-scored.

### Grading by Student Attempt

Grade an entire quiz submission for one student at a time.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select a student attempt">
From the Grade view, click on the student's name or their attempt to open the grading interface.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the attempt">
The evaluation screen displays:
- Student's answers to each question
- Auto-graded question scores
- Written response questions awaiting your score
- Total attempt score (partial until all questions are graded)
</Step>

<Step title="Grade written responses">
For each written response question:

1. Read the student's response
2. Enter the **Score** in the points field
3. Optionally, add **Feedback** in the feedback text box
4. The feedback can include formatting using the rich text editor
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate between questions">
Use the question navigation panel to jump between questions, or scroll through the attempt to review all responses in order.
</Step>

<Step title="Save and continue">
Click **Save** to record your grades for this attempt. Use the navigation arrows to move to the next student's attempt.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Grading by Question

Grade one question across all student attempts - useful for ensuring consistent scoring.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access question grading view">
From the Grade view, select the **Questions** tab (in the new evaluation experience) or look for the "Grade by question" option.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a question to grade">
Choose the specific question you want to grade across all attempts.
</Step>

<Step title="Review and score each response">
You will see each student's response to that specific question. Enter scores and feedback for each student, then navigate to the next response.
</Step>

<Step title="Complete grading for all questions">
Repeat for each manually-graded question in the quiz.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Consistency Tip">
Grading by question helps ensure you apply the same standards to all students for each question, reducing grading bias that can occur when fatigue sets in during by-student grading.
</Callout>

## Adding Feedback to Quiz Responses

Feedback helps students understand their performance and learn from mistakes.

### Question-Level Feedback

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the attempt for grading">
Navigate to the student's attempt in the Grade view.
</Step>

<Step title="Locate the feedback field">
Each question has a **Feedback** field below the student's response and score.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter your feedback">
Type your comments in the feedback text box. You can:
- Explain why points were deducted
- Provide the correct answer or reasoning
- Offer suggestions for improvement
- Include formatting, links, or images using the rich text editor
</Step>

<Step title="Save your feedback">
Click **Save** to record the feedback. Students will see this when viewing their graded attempt.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Overall Attempt Feedback

<Steps>
<Step title="Access attempt feedback">
While viewing a student's graded attempt, look for the **Overall Feedback** or **Attempt Feedback** section.
</Step>

<Step title="Add general comments">
Enter comments about the student's overall performance on the quiz. This appears separate from individual question feedback.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="When Students See Feedback">
Students see feedback based on your Quiz Results Display settings (configured in Evaluation and Feedback). If you have not enabled showing feedback in the submission view, students will not see your comments even after you enter them.
</Callout>

## Regrading Questions

When you discover an error in a question or need to adjust scoring after students have taken the quiz, use the regrade feature.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the quiz for editing">
From the Quizzes list, click the dropdown arrow next to the quiz name and select **Edit**.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to the question">
Click **Add/Edit Questions** and locate the question that needs correction.
</Step>

<Step title="Update the question">
Make necessary changes to the question, such as:
- Correcting the marked correct answer
- Updating point values
- Modifying question text
</Step>

<Step title="Apply regrade options">
When you save changes to a question with existing attempts, Brightspace prompts you with regrade options:

- **Give points to all participants** - Award the same points to everyone for this question, regardless of their answer (useful if the question was flawed)
- **Give points to participants with a specific answer** - Award full credit to students who selected a particular answer (useful if you discover an additional correct answer)
- **Regrade existing attempts** - Recalculate scores based on the updated correct answer
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm and save">
Select your regrade option and save. Brightspace will update affected attempt scores automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Regrade Carefully">
Regrading affects all existing attempts. Review the impact before confirming, especially for high-stakes assessments. Consider documenting why you made the change in case students have questions.
</Callout>

## Adjusting Individual Scores

Sometimes you need to modify a specific student's score without changing the quiz for everyone.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the student's attempt">
From the Grade view, click on the student's attempt you want to adjust.
</Step>

<Step title="Modify question scores">
For any question, you can manually override the auto-graded score by entering a different value in the Score field.
</Step>

<Step title="Add an explanation">
Use the feedback field to document why you adjusted the score (e.g., "Partial credit awarded for showing work").
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
Click **Save** to update the attempt. The new score will be reflected in the gradebook if the quiz is linked.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Adjusting Total Score">
Some quiz configurations allow you to adjust the overall attempt score directly. This is useful when you want to add bonus points or make a blanket adjustment without changing individual questions.
</Callout>

## Viewing Attempt Logs

Attempt logs provide detailed information about student activity during a quiz, including timing data and IP addresses.

### Accessing Attempt Logs

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Attempt Logs">
From the Quizzes list, click the dropdown arrow next to the quiz and select **Attempt Logs**.

</Callout>

## Allowing Additional Attempts

When students need another chance due to technical issues, accommodations, or other valid reasons, you can grant additional attempts.

### Using Special Access for Additional Attempts

<Steps>
<Step title="Edit the quiz">
From the Quizzes list, click the dropdown next to the quiz and select **Edit**.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Special Access settings">
In the **Availability Dates & Conditions** section, click **Manage Special Access**.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the student">
Click **Add Users to Special Access** and select the student who needs an additional attempt.
</Step>

<Step title="Override attempts allowed">
Check **Override Attempts Allowed** and enter the new total number of attempts for this student (e.g., 2 if they originally had 1).
</Step>

<Step title="Adjust dates if needed">
If the quiz availability has passed, also override the start and end dates to give the student access.
</Step>

<Step title="Save Special Access">
Click **Save** to apply. The student can now take the additional attempt.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Preserving Original Attempt">
Using Special Access to grant additional attempts keeps the student's original attempt intact. The gradebook will use whichever attempt score matches your grade calculation setting (highest, last, etc.).
</Callout>

## Resetting Quiz Attempts

Resetting an attempt permanently deletes it, allowing the student to retake the quiz as if they never started.

<Callout type="warning" title="Irreversible Action">
Resetting/deleting a quiz attempt cannot be undone. The student's original responses and score are permanently removed. Use this option only when necessary.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Grade view">
From the Quizzes list, click the dropdown next to the quiz and select **Grade**.
</Step>

<Step title="Select attempts to reset">
Check the box next to the student attempt(s) you want to reset.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Reset">
Click the **Reset** button at the top of the attempts list.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm the action">
In the confirmation dialog, click **Yes** to permanently delete the selected attempt(s).
</Step>

<Step title="Grant access if needed">
If the quiz has limited attempts or the availability window has closed, use Special Access to ensure the student can retake the quiz:
- Override the end date if it has passed
- Override attempts allowed if they have used all attempts
</Step>
</Steps>

### Reopening an Attempt

Instead of deleting, you can reopen a submitted attempt to allow the student to continue working.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Grade view">
Navigate to the quiz's Grade view.
</Step>

<Step title="Find the attempt to reopen">
Locate the student's submitted attempt. Note: Only the most recent submitted attempt can be reopened.

Check the box next to the attempt and click **Reopen** (or access this option from the attempt's dropdown menu).
</Step>

<Step title="Add extra time (optional)">
If the quiz has a time limit, you can add extra minutes for the reopened attempt.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm">
The attempt returns to "In Progress" status, and the student can continue where they left off.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Grade Synchronization with Gradebook

Quiz scores automatically sync with the gradebook when properly configured.

### Verifying Gradebook Connection

<Steps>
<Step title="Check quiz settings">
Edit the quiz and verify the **Grade Out Of** field has a value and the gradebook connection shows **In Grade Book**.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify auto-publish setting">
In the **Evaluation and Feedback** section, ensure **Auto-publish attempt results immediately upon completion** is enabled (if you want immediate grade transfer).
</Step>

<Step title="Check the grade item">
Go to **Grades** and verify the quiz grade item exists and shows student scores.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting Grade Sync Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Grades not appearing | Verify quiz is set to "In Grade Book" not "Not in Grade Book" |
| Only some grades showing | Manually graded questions may not be scored yet - complete grading |
| Scores showing as 0 | Check if attempts need to be published manually |
| Wrong grade item | Edit quiz and verify correct grade item is linked |

<Callout type="info" title="Publishing Grades">
If auto-publish is disabled, you must manually publish grades. From the Grade view, select the attempts you want to publish and click **Publish** (or the equivalent option in your interface).
</Callout>

## Quiz Statistics and Item Analysis

Analyze overall quiz performance and individual question effectiveness using statistics tools.

### Accessing Quiz Statistics

</Step>

<Step title="Review User Stats tab">
The **User Stats** tab displays:
- Performance data by student
- Score distribution across all attempts
- Class average percentage
- Individual student scores and percentages
</Step>

<Step title="Review Question Stats tab">
The **Question Stats** tab shows:
- Average score percentage for each question
- Which questions students struggled with most
- Overall question performance metrics
</Step>

<Step title="Review Question Details tab">
The **Question Details** tab provides in-depth item analysis:
- Correct answer for each question
- Percentage of students selecting each answer option
- Average grade per question
- Standard deviation
- **Discrimination Index** - How well the question differentiates high and low performers
- **Point Biserial** - Correlation between question score and total quiz score
</Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding Item Analysis Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Ideal Range |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Difficulty Index** | Percentage of students answering correctly | 0.3 - 0.7 (moderate difficulty) |
| **Discrimination Index** | How well question separates high/low performers | > 0.3 (good discrimination) |
| **Point Biserial** | Correlation with overall quiz performance | > 0.2 (positive correlation) |

<Callout type="tip" title="Using Statistics to Improve Quizzes">
Questions with very low discrimination or negative point biserial values may be confusing or poorly worded. Consider revising or removing these questions from future quizzes. Questions where the "wrong" answer was selected more often than the correct answer may indicate an error in your answer key.
