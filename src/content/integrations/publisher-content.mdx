# Publisher Content Integration

## Overview

Publisher content integrations allow you to connect courseware from major educational publishers directly to your Brightspace course. These integrations enable single sign-on access for students, automatic grade synchronization, and deep linking to specific content. This guide covers the most common publisher integrations: McGraw Hill Connect, Pearson MyLab and Mastering, and Cengage MindTap.

## Before You Begin

- Your institution must have the publisher integration configured by a Brightspace administrator
- You need instructor-level access to your Brightspace course
- You will need an instructor account with the publisher (often created during first-time setup)
- Students will need access codes or licenses for publisher content
- Verify with your IT department which LTI version (1.1 or 1.3) is installed

<Callout type="info" title="LTI Version Matters">
Most publishers now support LTI 1.3 (LTI Advantage), which offers improved security and more reliable grade sync. If your institution still uses LTI 1.1, contact your administrator about upgrading. New integrations should use LTI 1.3 whenever possible.
</Callout>

## How LTI Grade Passback Works

Understanding how grades flow between publisher platforms and Brightspace helps you troubleshoot issues and set up your courses correctly.

### The Grade Sync Process

1. **Link Creation**: When you add a graded activity link from a publisher tool, Brightspace automatically creates a corresponding grade column in your gradebook
2. **Student Launch**: Students click the link in your course content to access the publisher platform
3. **Account Linking**: The first time students launch, their Brightspace account is linked to their publisher account
4. **Work Completion**: Students complete assignments within the publisher platform
5. **Score Transmission**: The publisher platform sends scores back to Brightspace via the LTI connection
6. **Gradebook Update**: Scores appear in your Brightspace gradebook automatically

<Callout type="warning" title="First Launch Required">
Students MUST click the LTI link from within your Brightspace course at least once to establish the connection between their accounts. Grades will not sync for students who have not launched through Brightspace.
</Callout>

### Grade Sync Timing

- **Automatic sync**: Most integrations sync grades within seconds to 15 minutes of submission
- **Batch sync**: Some platforms sync grades in batches at regular intervals
- **Manual sync**: You can usually force a manual sync from within the publisher platform if needed

### What Does NOT Transfer

Be aware of these limitations with grade passback:

- **Grade categories**: Publisher category structures do not transfer to Brightspace
- **Weighted scores**: You must set up weighting manually in your Brightspace gradebook
- **Late penalties**: Some publisher late penalty settings may not reflect in Brightspace
- **Extra credit**: May require manual adjustment in Brightspace

Manual score syncs are processed after all current automatic syncs, so they may not be instant.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Student Registration and Pairing

Students must properly register with publisher platforms through your Brightspace course. Incorrect registration is a common source of problems.

### Student Access Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Students navigate to your course">
Students log into Brightspace and access your course.
</Step>

<Step title="Students click the publisher link">
Students click the publisher integration link (McGraw Hill, Pearson, Cengage, etc.) within your course content. This is the ONLY correct way to access publisher content.
</Step>

<Step title="Students create or link their account">
On first launch, students either:
- Create a new account with the publisher
- Link an existing publisher account to their Brightspace account
</Step>

<Step title="Students enter their access code">
If required, students enter their access code, which can be:
- A code purchased with the textbook
- A code purchased separately online
- A code provided through an institutional program (e.g., Inclusive Access)

Many publishers offer 14-day temporary access for students waiting for their access code.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical: Access Through Brightspace Only">
Students should NEVER go directly to the publisher website to register. The only correct route is through the links in your Brightspace course. Registering directly on the publisher site creates separate accounts that will not sync grades.
</Callout>

### Common Student Registration Issues

**Problem: Student registered on publisher site directly**
- The student created a separate account not linked to Brightspace
- **Solution**: Have the student click the Brightspace link. They may need to link their existing publisher account or contact publisher support to merge accounts.

**Problem: Student used different email address**
- Grades won't sync if email addresses don't match between systems
- **Solution**: Ensure students use their school email address in both Brightspace and the publisher platform.

**Problem: Student has two publisher accounts**
- Work completed in one account won't sync if a different account is linked to Brightspace
- **Solution**: Contact publisher technical support to merge the accounts.

**Problem: Access code not working**
- Code may be expired, already used, or for wrong product
- **Solution**: Have student contact publisher support with their access code details.

### Student Access Code Options

Most publishers offer multiple ways for students to gain access:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Access code with textbook** | Physical or digital code bundled with textbook purchase |
| **Standalone access code** | Purchased separately from bookstore or publisher website |
| **Credit/debit card** | Direct purchase within the publisher platform |
| **Institutional program** | Inclusive Access, First Day, or similar programs with automatic billing |
| **Temporary access** | 14-day free trial while waiting for access code |

## Managing Multiple Publisher Tools

Many courses use content from multiple publishers. Here's how to manage this effectively.

### Organization Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step title="Create separate modules for each publisher">
Create distinct modules in your Brightspace course for each publisher:
- "McGraw Hill Connect Assignments"
- "Pearson MyLab Homework"
- "Cengage MindTap Readings"

This helps students navigate and reduces confusion.
</Step>

<Step title="Use clear naming conventions">
Name links clearly so students know what they're accessing:
- "Chapter 1 Connect Homework" (not just "Assignment 1")
- "MyLab Quiz: Algebra Fundamentals"
</Step>

<Step title="Provide instructions for each platform">
Add a text item or page at the top of each publisher module explaining:
- What the platform is
- How to register/access it
- Where to get help
</Step>

<Step title="Organize your gradebook">
Create categories in your Brightspace gradebook to organize publisher grade items:
- McGraw Hill Connect (category)
- Pearson MyLab (category)
- Other Brightspace Assignments (category)
</Step>
</Steps>

### Communicating Requirements to Students

Create a course information page that lists:
- All required digital platforms and their costs
- Access code requirements for each platform
- Step-by-step first access instructions
- Links to publisher technical support
- Your institution's bookstore information

<Callout type="tip" title="Syllabus Information">
Include publisher platform requirements in your syllabus with clear cost information. Students appreciate knowing total course material costs upfront.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting Grade Sync Issues

Grade sync problems are the most common issue with publisher integrations. Use this guide to diagnose and resolve them.

### Quick Diagnostic Checklist

| Check | What to Verify |
|-------|----------------|
| Student launched from Brightspace | Student clicked the LTI link at least once |
| Automatic sync enabled | Grade sync is turned on in publisher settings |
| Grade column exists | Brightspace has a grade item for the assignment |
| Time elapsed | Allow 15-30 minutes for sync to complete |
| Assignment submitted | Student actually completed and submitted work |
| Due date respected | Submission was before due date (some tools check this) |
| Matching accounts | Student's email matches in both systems |

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Grades not appearing at all**

<Steps>
<Step title="Check sync settings">
Open the publisher platform and verify automatic grade sync is enabled for your course.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify grade column exists">
Check your Brightspace gradebook to confirm a grade column was created for the assignment.
</Step>

<Step title="Wait and recheck">
Allow 15-30 minutes for sync to complete, then check again.
</Step>

<Step title="Force manual sync">
Use the manual sync option in the publisher platform to push all grades.
</Step>

<Step title="Have students relaunch">
Ask students with missing grades to click the LTI link again from Brightspace.
</Step>
</Steps>

**Only some students' grades syncing**

- **Unlinked accounts**: Students who haven't clicked the Brightspace link won't have linked accounts
- **Different emails**: Students may have registered with different email addresses
- **Duplicate accounts**: Students may have multiple publisher accounts
- **Solution**: Have affected students click the Brightspace link. If issues persist, contact publisher support about account linking.

**Duplicate grade columns appearing**

- Often occurs when upgrading from LTI 1.1 to LTI 1.3
- May happen if the same assignment is deployed twice
- **Solution**: Delete the duplicate column in Brightspace. Verify which column is receiving grades before deleting.

**Scores don't match between systems**

- Check point values in both systems
- Verify no weighting is applied in one system but not the other
- Some publishers send percentage scores, not raw points
- **Solution**: Adjust point values or weighting as needed in Brightspace.

**Grades syncing late or after due date**

- Check that the date range in the publisher platform covers the current term
- Verify time zones match between systems
- Some tools only sync grades for submissions before the due date
- **Solution**: Adjust date settings or manually enter late grades.

### When to Contact Support

**Contact your institution's IT help desk when:**
- The publisher tool is not available in your course
- You receive persistent launch errors after clearing cache
- You need to upgrade from LTI 1.1 to LTI 1.3
- Grade sync issues persist after troubleshooting

**Contact the publisher's technical support when:**
- Students have account or access code issues
- You need help with publisher platform features
- Scores in the publisher gradebook appear incorrect
- You need accounts merged for students

### Publisher Support Contacts

| Publisher | Support Resources |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **McGraw Hill** | Email and live chat: Sunday 12pm-12am ET, Mon-Thu 24 hours, Friday 12am-9pm ET, Saturday 10am-8pm ET |
| **Pearson** | Contact through your Pearson rep or support.pearson.com |
| **Cengage** | cengage.com/support or contact your Cengage representative |

## Deep Linking to Specific Content

Deep linking allows you to create direct links to specific activities, chapters, or resources within publisher platforms.

### Benefits of Deep Linking

- Students go directly to relevant content without navigating the publisher platform
- You can organize content by topic rather than by platform
- Reduces confusion when using multiple resources
- Enables grade passback for specific activities

### Creating Deep Links

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the publisher integration">
From your Brightspace module, click **Existing Activities** and select the publisher tool.
</Step>

<Step title="Browse available content">
Navigate through the publisher's content to find the specific item you want to link (chapter, assignment, quiz, etc.).
</Step>

<Step title="Select the content item">
Click on or select the specific item. The system will create a deep link directly to that content.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure link settings">
Set options like:
- Whether to include in gradebook
- Display name for the link
- Availability dates (if applicable)
</Step>

<Step title="Save and verify">
Save the link and test it to ensure it opens directly to the intended content.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Deep Links and Grade Sync">
Graded deep links (like specific assignments or quizzes) will create corresponding grade columns in Brightspace. Non-graded links (like reading content) will not affect the gradebook.
</Callout>

## Best Practices for Publisher Integrations

### Before the Semester

1. **Test all integrations**: Click through every publisher link before students access the course
2. **Verify grade sync**: Create a test submission and confirm grades appear in Brightspace
3. **Document access requirements**: Clearly list what students need to purchase
4. **Set up gradebook categories**: Organize publisher grade items into categories
5. **Confirm time zones**: Ensure consistent time zones across all platforms

### During the Semester

1. **Monitor grade sync regularly**: Check weekly that grades are syncing correctly
2. **Respond to access issues quickly**: Address student login problems promptly
3. **Keep accounts linked**: Avoid changing email addresses or passwords mid-semester
4. **Communicate platform requirements**: Remind students to access through Brightspace

### When Copying Courses

1. **Delete old publisher links**: Many integrations require fresh links each semester
2. **Re-pair with publisher**: Follow the full setup process for the new course
3. **Verify all settings**: Check grade sync, due dates, and availability settings
4. **Test before students access**: Always test after copying a course

<Callout type="warning" title="LTI Links and Course Copies">
When you copy a Brightspace course, LTI links often do not work in the copied course. You must delete old links and create new ones using the publisher integration process. This is especially true for McGraw Hill Connect after their 2024 integration update.
