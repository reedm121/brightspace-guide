# Zoom and Teams Integration

## Overview

Video conferencing tools like Zoom and Microsoft Teams are essential for modern teaching, enabling virtual office hours, live lectures, guest speakers, and collaborative sessions. Brightspace integrates with both platforms, allowing you to schedule meetings, share links, and track attendance directly from your course.

This guide covers setting up and using both Zoom and Microsoft Teams integrations in Brightspace.

## Before You Begin

- Your institution must have Zoom LTI Pro or Microsoft Teams configured by an administrator
- You need an active Zoom or Microsoft 365 account (typically provided by your institution)
- You need instructor-level access to your Brightspace course
- Students will need Zoom or Teams accounts to join meetings (usually institutional accounts)

<Callout type="info" title="Administrator Setup Required">
Zoom and Teams integrations require initial configuration by your IT department. If you do not see these options in your course, contact your IT help desk to request the integration be enabled.

## Best Practices for Virtual Meetings

### Before the Meeting

1. **Test your setup**: Check audio, video, and screen sharing before each session
2. **Prepare your environment**: Ensure good lighting, minimal background noise, and a professional backdrop
3. **Share materials in advance**: Post slides or documents to Brightspace before the meeting
4. **Send reminders**: Use Brightspace announcements to remind students of upcoming sessions
5. **Have a backup plan**: Provide an alternative meeting link or phone number in case of technical issues

### During the Meeting

1. **Start recording promptly**: Begin recording as soon as the meeting starts for students who join late or cannot attend
2. **Use the waiting room**: Enable waiting room to control when students enter and review attendance
3. **Manage participants**: Mute all participants initially to prevent background noise
4. **Encourage participation**: Use polls, reactions, chat, and breakout rooms to keep students engaged
5. **Monitor the chat**: Assign a TA to watch for questions if possible
6. **Take breaks**: For sessions over 60 minutes, include short breaks

### After the Meeting

1. **Process recordings**: Ensure recordings are uploaded and accessible within 24 hours
2. **Share notes**: Post meeting summaries, key points, or follow-up materials to Brightspace
3. **Review attendance**: Download attendance reports for your records
4. **Follow up**: Address unanswered questions from the chat via announcements or email

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Enable captions**: Turn on live captions in Zoom or Teams for hearing-impaired students
- **Record for later**: Make recordings available for students who cannot attend synchronously
- **Share slides**: Provide accessible slide decks before or after the meeting
- **Describe visuals**: Verbally describe anything you show on screen
- **Allow multiple ways to participate**: Let students use chat if they cannot speak

<Callout type="tip" title="Engagement Strategies">
Virtual fatigue is real. Break up lectures with interactive elements: polls, breakout room discussions, collaborative documents, or short quizzes. Aim for interaction every 10-15 minutes.
</Callout>

## Comparison: Zoom vs. Teams

| Feature | Zoom | Microsoft Teams |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| Meeting duration (free) | 40 min limit | 60 min limit |
| Meeting duration (institutional) | Typically unlimited | Typically unlimited |
| Breakout rooms | Yes, highly flexible | Yes |
| Polling | Yes, built-in | Yes, via Forms integration |
| Whiteboard | Yes | Yes |
| Recording location | Zoom Cloud | OneDrive/SharePoint |
| Chat | In-meeting only | Persistent Team chat |
| Integration depth | LTI meetings | Meetings + Classes + Files |
| Calendar sync | Yes | Yes (Outlook integration) |

<Callout type="info" title="Which Should I Use?">
If your institution provides both, consider your needs: Zoom is often preferred for straightforward video meetings with robust breakout rooms. Teams is better when you want ongoing chat/collaboration outside of meetings or need tight Microsoft 365 integration.
</Callout>

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can students see meeting recordings automatically?**
Not automatically. You must share the recording link in Brightspace or adjust sharing settings to allow student access.

**Do students need paid Zoom/Teams accounts?**
No. Students can join meetings with free accounts or as guests. However, institutional accounts may be required for certain features like SSO authentication.

**Can I schedule meetings outside of Brightspace?**
Yes. You can schedule meetings directly in Zoom or Teams and manually add the links to Brightspace. However, using the integration provides better tracking and a more seamless student experience.

**What happens to meetings when I copy my course?**
Meeting links and schedules do NOT copy to new course sections. You must recreate or reschedule meetings for each new term.

**Can TAs or co-instructors start meetings?**
In Zoom, add them as Alternative Hosts. In Teams, add them as Co-organizers when scheduling the meeting.

**How do I handle time zone differences?**
Both Zoom and Teams display meeting times in the viewer's local time zone. However, always state the time zone explicitly in meeting titles or descriptions to avoid confusion.
