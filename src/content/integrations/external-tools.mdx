# External Tool Integrations

## Overview

Brightspace supports integration with a wide variety of third-party tools and publisher content through Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI). This guide covers how to work with external learning tools, publisher integrations, cloud storage connections, and video conferencing platforms.

## Before You Begin

- Your institution must have the external tool configured by an administrator
- You need instructor-level access to your Brightspace course
- For publisher integrations, you may need an instructor account with the publisher
- Students will need access codes or licenses for most publisher content

<Callout type="info" title="Administrator Configuration Required">
Most external tool integrations must first be set up by your institution's Brightspace administrator. If a tool you need is not available, contact your IT department to request its installation.
</Callout>

## Understanding LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability)

LTI is an industry standard developed by IMS Global that allows learning management systems like Brightspace to securely connect with external educational tools and content providers. Think of LTI as a bridge that enables:

- **Single sign-on**: Students access external tools without separate logins
- **Grade passback**: Scores from external tools automatically sync to your Brightspace gradebook
- **Deep linking**: Create links directly to specific content or activities
- **Roster sync**: Student enrollment data syncs between systems

### LTI Versions

| Version | Features | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| LTI 1.0/1.1 | Basic launch and grade passback | Legacy (still supported) |
| LTI 1.3 | Enhanced security, better content discovery | Current standard |
| LTI Advantage | Deep linking, names and roles, assignment and grade services | Recommended |

<Callout type="tip" title="LTI 1.3 Recommended">
If your institution is setting up new integrations, LTI 1.3 (LTI Advantage) is recommended for the latest features and improved security.
</Callout>

## Adding External Learning Tools to Your Course

Once an LTI tool has been configured by your administrator, you can add it to your course content.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your course content">
Open your Brightspace course and click **Content** in the course navbar. Select the module where you want to add the external tool.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the external tool">
Click **Existing Activities** and select the name of the external tool from the dropdown menu. If you see **External Learning Tools**, click that to see all available tools.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the tool link">

</Callout>

## Grade Passback from External Tools

Most LTI-integrated tools support automatic grade synchronization with your Brightspace gradebook.

### How Grade Passback Works

1. When you add an LTI link for a graded activity, Brightspace automatically creates a corresponding grade column
2. Students access the external tool through the link in your course content
3. When students complete and submit work in the external tool, scores are sent back to Brightspace
4. Grades appear in your Brightspace gradebook automatically

### Troubleshooting Grade Sync Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Grades not appearing | Wait 15-30 minutes; check that automatic sync is enabled in the external tool |
| Duplicate grade columns | May occur when migrating from LTI 1.1 to 1.3; delete the duplicate and verify settings |
| Scores not matching | Check point values in both systems; verify no weighting conflicts |
| Missing students | Ensure students have launched the LTI link at least once to establish the connection |

<Callout type="warning" title="Delete Activities Carefully">
When you delete an assignment, quiz, or LTI link, always delete it from within the Content module rather than from the external tool. Deleting from the tool side can leave broken links and cause sync issues.
</Callout>

## OneDrive Integration

Brightspace integrates with Microsoft OneDrive, allowing you to add files directly from your cloud storage to your course.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your content module">
Go to **Content** and select the module where you want to add the OneDrive file.
</Step>

<Step title="Add from OneDrive">
Click **Existing Activities** > **OneDrive**. If this is your first time, you may need to sign in to your Microsoft account.
</Step>

<Step title="Select your file">
Browse your OneDrive and select the file you want to add. Click **Select** to add it to your module.
</Step>
</Steps>

**Important Considerations:**

- **Live updates**: Changes you make to the document in OneDrive are immediately reflected in Brightspace
- **Default permissions**: Files are set to "Read Only" by default; change permissions if students need to edit
- **Student submissions**: When students submit OneDrive files to assignments, a copy is created at submission time; later changes in OneDrive are NOT reflected

<Callout type="info" title="File Size Limit">
Brightspace has a 2 GB upload limit for files. For larger files, consider linking to external storage or breaking content into smaller pieces.
</Callout>

## Google Drive Integration

Similar to OneDrive, Brightspace supports direct integration with Google Drive for adding content to your courses.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your content module">
Open **Content** and select the module where you want to add Google Drive content.
</Step>

<Step title="Add from Google Drive">
Click **Existing Activities** > **Google Drive**. The first time you use this, you will need to sign in to your Google account and grant permissions.
</Step>

<Step title="Select your file">
Browse your Google Drive, select the file you want to add, and confirm the selection.
</Step>
</Steps>

**Key Features:**

- Files from Google Drive link directly to the live document
- Any edits you make in Google Drive appear instantly in Brightspace
- Works with Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and other Google Workspace files
- Students can also submit Google Drive files to assignments and discussions

<Callout type="tip" title="Link vs. Upload">
When you add a Google Drive or OneDrive file, you are creating a link to the live document. This is different from uploading a static copy. Choose linking when you want updates to reflect automatically; upload a copy when you want a fixed snapshot.
</Callout>

- Students are having account or access code issues

## Requesting New Tool Integrations

If you need an external tool that is not currently available in Brightspace, follow this process:

<Steps>
<Step title="Document your requirements">
Prepare information about the tool:
- Tool name and vendor
- Purpose and how it will be used in your course
- Number of students who will use it
- Any licensing or cost information
</Step>

<Step title="Contact your IT/LMS administrator">
Submit a request through your institution's IT ticketing system or contact your LMS administrator directly. Include all the information gathered above.
</Step>

<Step title="Provide vendor contact information">
IT administrators will need to work with the tool vendor to:
- Obtain LTI credentials (Client ID, Secret, URLs)
- Configure the tool deployment
- Set appropriate permissions and org unit access
</Step>

<Step title="Allow time for configuration">
LTI tool setup requires coordination between your institution and the vendor. Allow adequate time before the semester begins for testing and configuration.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Pilot Programs">
For new tools, consider running a small pilot with one or two courses before wide deployment. This helps identify any issues before scaling to more students.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

1. **Test before the semester**: Always test LTI links and grade sync before students need to use them
2. **Provide clear instructions**: Include guidance for students on how to access and use external tools
3. **Monitor grade sync**: Periodically check that grades are syncing correctly throughout the semester
4. **Keep accounts linked**: Avoid changing email addresses or passwords mid-semester as this can break integrations
5. **Use consistent time zones**: Ensure Brightspace and external tools use the same time zone for due dates
6. **Document access requirements**: Clearly communicate any access codes, licenses, or accounts students need to purchase
