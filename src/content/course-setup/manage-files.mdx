# Managing Files (Manage Files Area)

## Overview

The Manage Files tool is Brightspace's central file management system for your course. Think of it as the "My Documents" folder for your course - every file you upload to Content, create with the HTML Editor, or import from cloud storage ends up here. This guide covers how to access, organize, and effectively manage all your course files.

## Before You Begin

- You need Instructor or higher permissions in your course
- Files in Manage Files are stored in the folder path starting with `/content/enforced/...`
- Any files you upload directly to Content automatically appear in Manage Files
- Deleting files from Manage Files will remove them from Content as well

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
Moving files or folders that are linked to Content items, quizzes, discussions, or announcements will break those links. Always verify where a file is being used before moving or deleting it.
</Callout>

## Accessing Manage Files

There are two ways to access the Manage Files tool in Brightspace.

### Method 1: Via Course Admin

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Course Admin">
From your course homepage, click **Course Admin** (or **Course Tools** depending on your navbar configuration).
</Step>

<Step title="Select Manage Files">
On the Course Administration page, locate and click **Manage Files** under the Site Resources section.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Via Content Area

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Content">
Navigate to **Content** in your course navbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Open Table of Contents">
Click on **Table of Contents** in the left sidebar.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Related Tools">
Click the **Related Tools** button and select **Manage Files** from the dropdown menu.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Access">
The Content method is useful when you are already working in the Content area and need to quickly access your file structure.
</Callout>

## Understanding the Interface

The Manage Files interface consists of two main areas:

- **Left Pane (Folder Tree)**: Shows your folder hierarchy. Click on any folder to view its contents in the right pane.
- **Right Pane (File List)**: Displays the files and subfolders within the selected folder.

### Toolbar Options

The toolbar at the top of the file list provides these actions:

| Icon | Function |
|------|----------|
| New Folder | Create a new folder |
| Upload | Upload files from your computer |
| Cut (scissors) | Cut selected files/folders for moving |
| Copy (documents) | Copy selected files/folders |
| Paste | Paste cut or copied items |
| Zip | Compress selected items into a ZIP file |
| Delete (trashcan) | Delete selected items |

## Folder Structure and Organization

A well-organized folder structure makes course maintenance much easier. D2L recommends creating a folder for each module/unit of content.

### Creating New Folders

<Steps>
<Step title="Select the parent location">
In the folder tree (left pane), click on the folder where you want to create a new subfolder.
</Step>

<Step title="Click New Folder">
Click the **New Folder** button in the toolbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Name your folder">
Enter a descriptive name for the folder. Best practice is to match folder names to your Content module/unit names for easy identification.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm creation">
Click **Create** or press Enter. The new folder will appear in the folder tree.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Recommended Folder Structure">
Consider organizing your folders to match your course structure:
- Unit 1 - Introduction
- Unit 2 - Core Concepts
- Unit 3 - Applications
- Assessments
- Resources
- Syllabus and Policies
</Callout>

### Setting Default Paths for Modules/Units

You can configure Brightspace to automatically save uploaded files to specific folders based on the Content module/unit.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Content">
Go to **Content** in your course navbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Open module/unit options">
Click the down-caret (dropdown arrow) next to the module/unit name to open the action menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Set Default Path">
Choose **Set Default Path** from the dropdown options.
</Step>

<Step title="Change the path">
Click the **Change Path** button and navigate to the folder you created for this module/unit.
</Step>

<Step title="Select and save">
Click on the destination folder, then click **Select Path**. Finally, click **Save** to confirm.
</Step>
</Steps>

From now on, all files uploaded to that module/unit will automatically be stored in the designated folder.

## Uploading Files Directly to Manage Files

While you can upload files through the Content area, uploading directly to Manage Files gives you more control over organization.

In Manage Files, click on the folder where you want to upload your file.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Upload">

Over time, courses can accumulate unused files. Here is how to identify and clean them up.

### Identifying Orphaned Files

<Steps>

For each file, check the 360-degree view (context menu > view usage) to see if it is linked anywhere in your course.
</Step>

Review your Content modules/units to identify files that were removed from Content but remain in Manage Files.
</Step>

<Step title="Use accessibility tools">
If your institution has Ally or similar tools, they can help identify files that may not be in use.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Cleaning Up Unused Files

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Manage Files">
Go to **Course Admin > Manage Files**.
</Step>

<Step title="Review each folder">
Systematically review folders for files no longer needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify before deleting">
Always check the 360-degree view before deleting to ensure the file is not linked elsewhere.
</Step>

<Step title="Delete unused files">
Select the files confirmed as unused and delete them.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="End-of-Term Cleanup">
At the end of each term, take time to review and clean up your course files. Remove outdated assignments, old syllabus versions, and unused media to keep your course organized for future terms.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

1. **Create folders before uploading**: Set up your folder structure before adding files to stay organized from the start.

2. **Match folders to modules/units**: Name your Manage Files folders to correspond with your Content module/unit names.

3. **Set default paths**: Configure default paths for each module/unit so uploaded files automatically go to the right folder.

4. **Use descriptive file names**: Avoid generic names like "document.pdf" - use descriptive names like "Week3_Assignment_Instructions.pdf".

5. **Avoid special characters**: Keep file names free of special characters (! @ # $ % ^ & *) to prevent compatibility issues.

6. **Check before moving**: Always verify a file is not linked elsewhere before moving or deleting it.

7. **Regular maintenance**: Schedule periodic reviews to remove unused files and maintain organization.

8. **Back up important files**: Regularly download ZIP archives of critical course materials for safekeeping.

## Common Issues

### File not appearing after upload
- Refresh the page
- Check if the file is in the correct folder
- Verify the file was under the 2GB limit
- Try a different browser or clear your cache

### Broken links after moving files
- Files linked to Content will break if moved
- Restore files to their original location or update the links in Content

### Cannot delete files
- Verify you have Instructor permissions
- Check if the file is part of a published assessment
- Some system files cannot be deleted

### ZIP extraction fails
- Ensure the ZIP file is under 2GB
- Check for special characters in file names within the archive
- Try creating a new ZIP file without nested folder structures
