# Checklists

## Overview

**Checklists** in Brightspace are organizational tools that help students track their progress through tasks, readings, or activities. Unlike the automatic completion tracking in Content, checklists allow students to manually check off items as they complete them, giving them ownership over their progress tracking.

<Callout type="info" title="Student-Driven Tracking">
Checklists are manually checked by students—Brightspace doesn't automatically mark items complete. This makes them ideal for tasks that happen outside Brightspace (readings, practice problems, study activities) or for giving students agency in tracking their own progress.
</Callout>

## Why Use Checklists?

Checklists serve several purposes in course design:

| Purpose | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Progress Tracking** | Help students see what they've completed and what remains |
| **Organization** | Break complex projects into manageable steps |
| **Study Guides** | Provide a structured list of materials to review |
| **Self-Paced Learning** | Let students work through content at their own pace |
| **External Tasks** | Track activities that happen outside Brightspace |
| **Accountability** | Students commit to completing items by checking them |

<Callout type="tip" title="Complement, Don't Replace">
Checklists work best alongside Brightspace's automatic completion tracking, not as a replacement. Use checklists for items that can't be automatically tracked.
</Callout>

## Accessing Checklists

To access the Checklists tool:

1. Go to **Course Admin** in your course navbar
2. Look for **Checklists** under the Course Administration tools
3. Click to open the Checklist management area

To add Checklists to your navbar:
1. Contact your administrator, or
2. Add it through Navigation settings if you have permission

## Creating a Checklist

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Checklists Tool">
Navigate to **Course Admin** > **Checklists** and click **New Checklist**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Checklist Details">
- **Name**: Give the checklist a descriptive title (e.g., "Module 3 Study Guide" or "Final Project Steps")
- **Description** (optional): Explain the purpose of the checklist and how students should use it
</Step>

<Step title="Set Visibility">
Choose when the checklist is available:
- **Display in Calendar**: Show checklist item due dates in the course calendar
- **Visibility**: Control whether students can see the checklist
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Checklist">
Click **Save** to create the checklist. You'll then add categories and items.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Categories and Items

Checklists are organized into categories, which contain individual items.

### Adding a Category

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Your Checklist">
Click on the checklist you want to edit.
</Step>

<Step title="Add a Category">
Click **Add Category** and enter:
- **Name**: Category title (e.g., "Required Readings" or "Week 1 Tasks")
- **Description** (optional): Additional context for this category
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Category">
Click **Save**. The category appears as a section in your checklist.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Adding Items to a Category

<Steps>
<Step title="Select the Category">
Click on the category where you want to add items, or click **Add Item** below the category.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Item Details">
- **Name**: The task or item description (e.g., "Read Chapter 5, pages 120-145")
- **Description** (optional): Additional details or instructions
- **Due Date** (optional): When this item should be completed
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Item">
Click **Save**. The item appears under its category with a checkbox.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Organizing Items

- **Reorder items**: Drag and drop to rearrange items within a category
- **Move between categories**: Drag items to different categories
- **Reorder categories**: Change the order of categories in the checklist

## Setting Due Dates

Due dates help students prioritize and manage their time.

### Item-Level Due Dates

Each checklist item can have its own due date:

1. Edit the item
2. Set the **Due Date** and time
3. Save the item

Items with due dates will:
- Show the date next to the item
- Appear in the course calendar (if enabled)
- Be highlighted when approaching or past due

### Best Practices for Due Dates

- Align checklist due dates with related assignment due dates
- Spread due dates throughout the week rather than clustering
- Consider setting checklist items due 1-2 days before related assessments
- Use due dates for time-sensitive items, leave others without dates

<Callout type="warning" title="Due Dates Are Suggestions">
Checklist due dates are informational only—students can still check items after the due date, and there's no automatic penalty. If you need enforced deadlines, use assignments with due dates instead.
</Callout>

## Using Checklists with Release Conditions

Checklists integrate with Brightspace's release conditions in two ways:

### Controlling Checklist Visibility

Use release conditions to show checklists only when students are ready:

1. Edit the checklist settings
2. Add a release condition (e.g., "Show after completing Module 2")
3. Students only see the checklist after meeting the condition

### Using Checklist Completion as a Condition

You can use checklist completion to unlock other content:

1. On any content item, assignment, or quiz, add a release condition
2. Select "Checklist item completed" as the condition type
3. Choose the specific checklist and item
4. Content unlocks when the student checks that item

<Callout type="info" title="Honor System">
Since students manually check items, using checklist completion as a release condition relies on student honesty. Consider this when designing critical course paths.
</Callout>

## Viewing Student Progress

### Class-Wide View

## Best Practices

### Checklist Design

- **Keep items specific and actionable**: "Read pages 50-75" is better than "Do the reading"
- **Use categories to organize**: Group related items together
- **Include time estimates**: "Watch video (15 min)" helps students plan
- **Don't overwhelm**: Limit to 10-15 items per checklist when possible

### Effective Use

- **Introduce checklists early**: Show students how to use them in week 1
- **Explain the purpose**: Tell students why the checklist helps their learning
- **Review progress**: Periodically check class-wide completion rates
- **Connect to success**: Show students how checklist completion correlates with grades

### When to Use Checklists

**Good for:**
- Reading assignments
- Study preparation
- Multi-step projects
- Orientation tasks
- Self-assessment activities

**Not ideal for:**
- Tasks that can be automatically tracked (use Content completion instead)
- High-stakes requirements (use Assignments with due dates)
- Items requiring verification (use Quizzes or Assignments)

<Callout type="tip" title="Combine Approaches">
For comprehensive tracking, use checklists for items outside Brightspace and Content completion tracking for items within Brightspace. This gives you and students the fullest picture of progress.
</Callout>

## Common Issues

### Students Not Seeing Checklists

- Verify the checklist is set to visible
- Check for release conditions that might be hiding it
- Ensure the Checklists tool is available in your course navbar or Course Admin

### Checklist Completion Not Unlocking Content

- Verify the release condition is set correctly
- Remember that students must manually check the item
- Check that the condition references the correct checklist and item

### Due Dates Not Showing in Calendar

- Edit the checklist settings and enable "Display in Calendar"
- Verify the calendar widget is visible on the course homepage
- Check individual item due dates are set
