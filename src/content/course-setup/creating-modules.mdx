# Creating and Organizing Modules

## Overview

Modules are the foundation of course organization in Brightspace. Think of them as chapters in a textbook or folders on your computer - they help you group related content together so students can easily navigate your course materials.

Before adding any content to your course, you must first create a module. All topics (files, links, activities) must reside within a module - they cannot exist at the root level of your course.

<Callout type="info" title="Classic vs. New Content Experience">
Brightspace offers two content experiences. This guide covers the Classic Content Experience, which uses "Modules." The New Content Experience uses "Units" with similar functionality. Your institution determines which experience is available.
</Callout>

## Understanding the Module Structure

Brightspace content follows a hierarchical structure:

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Table of Contents** | The root level containing all modules | Course Content |
| **Module** | Top-level organizational container | Week 1: Introduction |
| **Sub-module** | Nested container within a module | Week 1 Readings |
| **Topic** | Individual content items | syllabus.pdf, assignment link |

## Creating a New Module

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Content">
From your course navbar, click **Content** to access the Content area. You'll see the Table of Contents panel on the left side of the screen.
</Step>

<Step title="Add a module">
In the Table of Contents panel, locate the **Add a module...** field at the bottom of the module list. Click in this field and type the name of your new module (e.g., "Week 1: Course Introduction").
</Step>

<Step title="Press Enter to create">
Press **Enter** on your keyboard to create the module. The new module will appear in the Table of Contents and will be visible to students by default.
</Step>

<Step title="Add a description (optional)">
Click on your new module to open it. You can add a description by clicking **Add a description...** below the module title. Use this to provide context about what students will learn or accomplish in this module.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Module Descriptions">
Good module descriptions include: the module topic and overview, learning objectives, a list of activities to complete, and any important information students need to know.
</Callout>

## Creating Sub-modules

Sub-modules allow you to create nested organization within a module. They're useful for complex courses with many topics.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select the parent module">
Click on the module where you want to add a sub-module from the Table of Contents panel.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the sub-module">
Inside the module view, locate the **Add a sub-module...** field. Enter the name of your sub-module and press **Enter**.
</Step>

<Step title="Add content to the sub-module">
Click on the sub-module name to open it, then add content just as you would to a regular module.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Use Sub-modules Sparingly">
Adding too many sub-modules can make navigation confusing for students. When a student enters a sub-module, they can no longer see items in the parent module from the Table of Contents. Consider using sub-modules only when you have substantial content that truly needs additional organization.
</Callout>

## Adding Content to Modules

Once you have created a module, you can add various types of content. Click on a module to open it, then use one of these methods:

### Upload/Create Options

Click the **Upload/Create** button to see these options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Upload Files** | Add documents, PDFs, images, or other files from your computer |
| **Create a File** | Build a new HTML page directly in Brightspace |
| **Create a Link** | Add a link to an external website or resource |
| **Video or Audio** | Add multimedia content |
| **New Assignment** | Create an assignment submission folder |
| **New Discussion** | Create a discussion topic |
| **New Quiz** | Create a quiz or assessment |
| **New Checklist** | Create a task checklist for students |
| **New Survey** | Create a survey for feedback |

### Adding Existing Activities

Click the **Existing Activities** button to link content you've already created in other Brightspace tools:

- Assignments
- Discussions
- Quizzes
- External Learning Tools (LTI)
- ePortfolio Items
- Surveys

### Drag and Drop

You can also drag files directly from your computer into the module content area. Brightspace will automatically upload them as topics.

<Callout type="info" title="Content Security">
Brightspace uses a sandboxing feature that creates a secure iFrame around HTML files. This protects against unauthorized scripts while still allowing JavaScript functionality within your content.
</Callout>

## Reordering Modules and Content

### Using Drag and Drop

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the drag handle">
Find the eight-dot icon (drag handle) to the left of the module or topic name you want to move.
</Step>

<Step title="Drag to the new position">
Click and hold the drag handle, then drag the item to your desired location. Watch for visual indicators:
- **Solid blue line**: The item will be placed above or below at that position
- **Highlighted module (blue/orange)**: The item will be placed inside that module
</Step>

<Step title="Release to drop">
Let go of the mouse button to place the item in its new location.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Accidental Sub-modules">
When dragging modules, be careful not to accidentally drop them onto another module, which would convert them to sub-modules. If this happens, your module may seem to disappear - check inside other modules to find it.
</Callout>

### Using the Actions Menu

For more precise control, use the Actions menu (dropdown arrow next to the item name):

- **Move Up/Move Down**: Shift the item one position within its current module
- **Move To**: Select a different module to move the item into
- **Send to Root**: Move a sub-module back to the top level (main module)

## Bulk Editing Module Properties

When you need to edit multiple items at once, use the Bulk Edit feature.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the module">
Navigate to the module containing the items you want to edit.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Bulk Edit">
Click the **Bulk Edit** button at the top of the content area.
</Step>

<Step title="Make your changes">
In Bulk Edit mode, you can modify:
- **Visibility**: Click the eye icon to toggle items between visible and hidden
- **Dates**: Edit start dates, end dates, and due dates
- **Titles**: Click on titles to edit them inline
- **Descriptions**: Click on descriptions to modify them
</Step>

<Step title="Save your changes">
Click **Done Editing** at the top of the screen to save all changes and return to normal view.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Bulk Edit Limitation">
Only topics within a module can be bulk edited. Module-level properties (module title, description, dates) must be edited individually.
</Callout>

## Module Visibility Settings

Control when and whether students can see your modules and content.

### Hiding Modules

To hide a module or topic from students:

1. Click the **dropdown arrow** next to the module or topic name
2. Select **Hide from Users**
3. The item will show a "Hidden" indicator

Alternatively, in Bulk Edit mode, click the **eye icon** to toggle visibility.

### Using Date Restrictions

Set automatic visibility windows based on dates:

<Steps>
<Step title="Select the module or topic">
Click on the module or topic you want to restrict.
</Step>

<Step title="Add dates and restrictions">
Click **Add dates and restrictions...** below the item title.
</Step>

<Step title="Set your dates">
Configure the following options:
- **Start Date**: When the content becomes visible
- **End Date**: When the content is no longer visible
- **Due Date**: When work should be completed (appears in Calendar)
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
Click **Update** to apply the date restrictions.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Calendar Integration">
When you set dates on modules or topics, they automatically appear in the course Calendar and the Upcoming Events widget, helping students track deadlines.
</Callout>

## Best Practices for Module Organization

### Choose a Logical Structure

The two most effective organization methods are:

1. **By Week**: Organize content chronologically (Week 1, Week 2, etc.)
   - Best for courses with regular schedules
   - Easy for students to follow along with the semester

2. **By Topic**: Organize content thematically (Unit 1: Cell Biology, Unit 2: Genetics)
   - Best for courses covering distinct subject areas
   - Allows flexible pacing

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid Organizing by Content Type">
Don't organize modules by content type (all readings in one module, all assignments in another). Brightspace already provides this grouping through the Course Tools menu. Instead, keep all materials for a topic or week together.
</Callout>

### Use Descriptive Module Names

Instead of generic titles like "Week 1" or "Module 2," use descriptive names that reflect the content:

| Avoid | Better |
|-------|--------|
| Week 1 | Week 1: Introduction to Research Methods |
| Module 3 | Foundations of Statistical Analysis |
| Unit A | Understanding Market Forces |

### Keep Navigation Simple

- **Limit main modules to 10-12**: Too many choices overwhelm students
- **Minimize sub-module levels**: Use at most two levels of nesting
- **Keep module titles short**: Long titles truncate in the navigation

### Create Consistent Module Structure

Help students know what to expect by using a consistent format within each module:

1. **Introduction page**: Overview, objectives, what to expect
2. **Content items**: Readings, videos, lecture materials
3. **Activities**: Discussions, assignments, quizzes
4. **Summary/checklist**: Wrap-up and task list

### Include a Course Overview Module

Create a dedicated module at the top of your Table of Contents for essential course information:

- Syllabus
- Course schedule
- Instructor contact information
- Getting started guide
- Technical requirements

<Callout type="tip" title="Use Checklists">
Add a Brightspace Checklist to each module listing all required tasks. Students appreciate being able to track their progress and ensure they haven't missed anything.
</Callout>

## Deleting Modules

<Callout type="warning" title="Deletion Warning">
Deleting a module deletes all topics within that module. Make sure to move any content you want to keep before deleting.
</Callout>

To delete a module:

1. Click the **dropdown arrow** next to the module name
2. Select **Delete**
3. Choose whether to:
   - Remove from Content view only (files remain in course)
   - Permanently delete all content
