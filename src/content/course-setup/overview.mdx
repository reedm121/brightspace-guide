# Content

## What is the Content Tool?

The **Content** tool is where you organize and deliver all your course materials in Brightspace. Think of it as your course's digital bookshelf—a structured space where students access readings, videos, assignments, and any other learning resources you provide.

Content is typically the most-visited area of any Brightspace course. It's where students go to find what they need to learn and complete for your class.

## Why Use Content?

The Content tool provides:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Organization** | Group materials into logical modules (by week, topic, or unit) |
| **Sequencing** | Control the order students encounter materials |
| **Conditional Access** | Release content based on dates, grades, or completion of other items |
| **Tracking** | Monitor which students have accessed which materials |
| **Integration** | Link directly to assignments, quizzes, discussions, and external tools |

<Callout type="tip" title="Student Experience">
A well-organized Content area reduces student confusion and support requests. Students should be able to find what they need quickly and understand what's expected each week.

## Understanding the Content Structure

Content in Brightspace follows a hierarchical structure:

```
Content Area
└── Module (e.g., "Week 1" or "Unit: Photosynthesis")
    └── Sub-Module (optional nesting)
        └── Topics (individual items)
            - Files (PDFs, documents, presentations)
            - HTML pages (text, images, embedded media)
            - Links (external websites, videos)
            - Activities (assignments, quizzes, discussions)
```

### Modules
Modules are containers that organize your course materials. Most instructors create modules for each week or unit of the course. Modules can contain:
- Individual content items (files, pages, links)
- Links to course activities (assignments, quizzes, discussions)
- Sub-modules for additional organization

### Topics
Topics are the individual items within a module—the actual content students interact with. A topic might be:
- A PDF reading
- An HTML page you created
- A link to an external video
- A connection to an assignment or quiz

## Accessing Content

To access the Content tool:

1. From your course navbar, click **Content**
2. You'll see the Table of Contents on the left and content items on the right

## Best Practices

### Organizing Your Course
- Use a consistent naming convention for modules (e.g., "Week 1: Introduction" or "Module 1: Foundations")
- Place the most important items at the top of each module
- Include a brief overview or instructions at the start of each module
- Don't create too many levels of sub-modules—2 levels deep is usually sufficient

### Content Visibility
- Hide modules that aren't ready for students yet
- Use the "Draft" status for content you're still developing
- Preview your course as a student to verify what they see

### File Management
- Use descriptive file names (not "Document1.pdf")
- Consider file sizes—large files may be slow for students to download
- Provide alternative formats when possible (e.g., PDF and Word)

## Common Questions

**Can students see hidden content?**
No. Hidden modules and topics are completely invisible to students. Only items set to "Visible" appear in the student view.

**What's the difference between hiding content and using release conditions?**
Hiding content makes it invisible. Release conditions can either hide content OR show it as locked (visible but inaccessible) until conditions are met.

**Can I reorder modules after creating them?**
Yes. Drag and drop modules in the Table of Contents to reorder them, or use the "Reorder" option from the module's context menu.

**How do I copy content from another course?**
Use the Import/Export feature in Course Admin, or copy individual items using the "Copy" option. See the Course Management guides for details.
