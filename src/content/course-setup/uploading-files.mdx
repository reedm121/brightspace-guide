# Uploading Files

## Overview

Brightspace offers multiple methods for uploading files to your course, from simple drag-and-drop to cloud storage integrations. This guide covers all the ways you can add files to your course and organize them effectively.

## Before You Begin

- Ensure your files are under the 2GB size limit (1.5GB recommended for smoother uploads)
- Use standard file naming without special characters (avoid ! @ # $ % ^ & * etc.)
- Have your files organized on your computer or cloud storage
- If using Turnitin, note the 40MB file size limit for those submissions

## Upload Methods

### Method 1: Drag-and-Drop Upload

The fastest way to add files directly to your course content.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Content">
Go to **Content** in your course navbar and select the module/unit where you want to add files.
</Step>

<Step title="Locate the drop zone">
Look for the area that says **"Drag and drop files here to create and update topics."** This appears at the bottom of your module/unit content.
</Step>

<Step title="Drag your files">
Open a file explorer window on your computer, select the files you want to upload, and drag them directly over the dotted drop zone in Brightspace.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm the upload">
Release the files when you see the drop zone highlight. You will see a "Content uploaded successfully" message when complete.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Tip">
You can drag multiple files at once to upload them in a batch. Each file will become a separate topic in your module/unit.
</Callout>

### Method 2: Upload from Computer Button

Use this method for more control over upload settings and file placement.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your module/unit">
Go to **Content** in your course navbar and open the module/unit where you want to add the file.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Upload/Create">
Click the **Upload/Create** button located in the module/unit toolbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Upload Files">
From the dropdown menu, select **Upload Files**.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose your file">
In the pop-up window that appears:
1. Click the **Upload** button to browse your computer
2. Or drag files into the dotted upload area
3. Select the file(s) you want to upload
</Step>

<Step title="Configure options and add">
Set any desired options (such as file description) and click **Add** to complete the upload.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Method 3: Google Drive Integration

Upload files directly from your Google Drive account into Brightspace.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your module/unit">
Go to **Content** in your course navbar and select the destination module/unit.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Google Drive option">
Click **Existing Activities** (or **Upload/Create**), then select **Google Drive** from the dropdown menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Sign in to Google">
If this is your first time, you will be prompted to sign in to your Google account and grant Brightspace permission to access your files.
</Step>

<Step title="Select your file">
Browse your Google Drive and select the file you want to add.
</Step>

<Step title="Set sharing permissions">
In the pop-up window:

- Leave unchecked to upload a static copy of the file
</Step>

<Step title="Add the file">
Click **Add** to insert the file into your module/unit.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Live Link vs. Static Copy">
When you enable the "Allow everyone" option, any changes you make to the document in Google Drive are pushed instantly to Brightspace. If you upload a static copy, the file is converted to Microsoft format and will not reflect future edits.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Formatting Note">
Uploaded offline files from Google Drive automatically convert to Microsoft file formats, which may cause formatting issues. Use live links to preserve original formatting.
</Callout>

### Method 4: OneDrive Integration

Upload files directly from your Microsoft OneDrive account.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your module/unit">
Go to **Content** and select the module/unit where you want to add the file.
</Step>

<Step title="Access OneDrive option">
Click **Existing Activities** or look for the OneDrive option in the Quicklinks Activity Bar (if enabled by your institution).
</Step>

<Step title="Sign in to Microsoft">
Sign in to your Microsoft account when prompted to grant Brightspace access.
</Step>

Navigate through your OneDrive folders and select the file(s) you want to add.
</Step>

<Step title="Set permissions">
Configure sharing settings. By default, files are set to "Read Only" - adjust if you need students to edit.
</Step>

<Step title="Add to course">
Click **Add** to insert the file into your Brightspace module/unit.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="OneDrive Expiration">
OneDrive allows you to set an end date for file sharing, which can be useful for time-limited access to course materials.
</Callout>

## Manage Files Area

## Bulk Upload Options

### Uploading Multiple Files at Once

You can upload multiple files simultaneously using these methods:

2. **Upload Dialog**: In the Upload Files dialog, select multiple files from your computer using Ctrl/Cmd + Click
3. **Manage Files**: Navigate to Manage Files and upload directly to organize files before linking to Content

### Uploading ZIP Files

For large numbers of files, consider uploading a ZIP archive:

### Importing from Another Course

If you need to transfer content from an existing course:

1. Use the **Import/Export/Copy Components** tool in Course Admin
2. Select the source course and the content you want to import
3. This method preserves folder structure and file organization

## File Size Limits

| File Type | Size Limit |
|-----------|------------|
| Standard uploads | 2GB per file (1.5GB recommended) |
| Turnitin submissions | 40MB and 400 pages maximum |
| Media Library | 2GB per file |

<Callout type="warning" title="Large File Warning">
While Brightspace technically allows files up to 2GB, larger files (over 50MB) can cause issues for both uploading and student downloads. Consider compressing large files or using external hosting for video content.
</Callout>

## Supported File Types

Brightspace supports most common file types including:

- **Documents**: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .rtf, .txt, .odt, .wpd, .pptx, .ppt, .xlsx, .xls

<Callout type="danger" title="Blocked File Types">
For security purposes, certain executable file extensions are blocked and cannot be uploaded (e.g., .exe, .bat, .js). If you need to distribute code files, consider using a ZIP archive or renaming the extension.
</Callout>

### File Naming Best Practices

- Avoid special characters: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + = | \ / ? " ' : ; ~ `
- Use underscores or hyphens instead of spaces
- Keep names descriptive but concise
- Include version numbers or dates if applicable (e.g., `Syllabus_Spring2026_v2.pdf`)

## Linking Uploaded Files to Content

After uploading files to Manage Files, you can link them to your course modules/units:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your module/unit">
Go to **Content** and open the destination module/unit.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Existing Activities">
Click **Existing Activities** in the module/unit toolbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Select the file location">
Choose the appropriate option based on where your file is stored (e.g., from the file repository).
</Step>

<Step title="Browse and select">
Navigate to your file in Manage Files and select it.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure display options">
Set how the file should appear to students (new window, embedded, etc.) and click **Add**.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Reuse Files">
Since files in Manage Files can be linked multiple times, you can reference the same syllabus, resource, or reference document from multiple modules/units without creating duplicates.
</Callout>

## Common Issues

### Upload fails or times out

- Ensure you are looking in the correct module/unit

### Students cannot access files
- Verify the module/unit and topic visibility settings
- Check release conditions that might restrict access
- Ensure the file format is compatible with student devices

### Google/OneDrive integration not working
- Contact your institution's IT department - cloud integrations require admin configuration
- Verify your Google/Microsoft account has the correct permissions
- Try signing out and back in to refresh the connection
