# Course Admin

## What is Course Admin?

**Course Admin** (sometimes called **Course Tools** or found under the gear icon) is where you access administrative settings and tools for your Brightspace course. It's the central location for course-wide settings, imports, exports, and advanced configuration options.

While you'll spend most of your time in Content, Grades, and Assignments, Course Admin is where you go to configure how your course works behind the scenes.

## Accessing Course Admin

To access Course Admin:

1. From your course navbar, look for **Course Admin**, **Settings**, or a gear (⚙️) icon
2. Click to open the Course Administration area
3. You'll see a list of available tools and settings

<Callout type="info" title="Location Varies">
Different institutions configure Course Admin differently. It might be a direct navbar link, under a dropdown, or accessed via a gear icon. If you can't find it, ask your institution's help desk.

## Common Questions

**Why can't I see certain tools?**
Your institution controls which tools are available. Contact your help desk if you need access to a specific tool.

**Will students see Course Admin?**
No. Course Admin is only visible to instructors and TAs. Students do not have access to administrative tools.

**Can I undo changes made in Course Admin?**
Some changes can be undone, but not all. Major actions (like deleting content) may be permanent. Export a backup before making significant changes.

**What's the difference between Course Admin and editing content?**
Course Admin contains settings and tools that affect the whole course. Editing content (assignments, quizzes, etc.) is done within those specific tools.
