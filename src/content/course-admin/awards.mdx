# Awards and Badges

## Overview

The **Awards** tool in Brightspace allows you to create digital badges and certificates to recognize student achievements. Awards can be granted automatically based on conditions (like completing a module or achieving a grade threshold) or manually by instructors.

<Callout type="info" title="Tool Availability">
The Awards tool may not be enabled at all institutions. If you don't see Awards in Course Admin, contact your Brightspace administrator.
</Callout>

## Why Use Awards?

Awards and badges tap into gamification principles to increase student motivation:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Recognition** | Acknowledge student accomplishments publicly or privately |
| **Motivation** | Give students something to work toward beyond grades |
| **Progress Markers** | Help students see their advancement through the course |
| **Engagement** | Add an element of fun and achievement to learning |
| **Completion Incentive** | Encourage students to complete optional content |

<Callout type="tip" title="Research-Backed">
Studies show that digital badges can increase student engagement and motivation, particularly for completing optional or supplemental materials. They're most effective when tied to meaningful achievements.
</Callout>

## Types of Awards

Brightspace supports two types of awards:

### Badges

- **Visual icons** displayed on student profiles
- Can be earned multiple times (or limited to once)
- Typically represent smaller achievements
- Examples: "Discussion Champion," "Perfect Quiz Score," "Early Bird Submitter"

### Certificates

- **Formal documents** that can be printed or downloaded
- Usually awarded once for significant achievements
- Can include customized text and student information
- Examples: "Course Completion Certificate," "Honor Roll," "Excellence Award"

## Accessing the Awards Tool

To access Awards:

1. Go to **Course Admin** in your course navbar
2. Under the **Learner Management** or **Student Success** section, click **Awards**
3. You'll see a list of available awards and tools to create new ones

## Creating a Badge

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Awards Tool">
Navigate to **Course Admin** > **Awards** and click **Add Award to Course** or **Create Award**.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Badge Type">
Select **Badge** as the award type.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Badge Details">
Configure the badge settings:

- **Name**: A clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Discussion Master")
- **Description**: Explain what the badge represents and how to earn it
- **Availability**: Set whether the badge is available (visible to students)
</Step>

<Step title="Upload or Select an Icon">
Choose an image for the badge:

- **Upload**: Use your own image (recommended size: 100x100 pixels, PNG or JPG)
- **Select from library**: Choose from built-in badge icons (if available)

The icon should be visually distinctive and relate to the achievement.
</Step>

<Step title="Set Award Criteria">
Choose how the badge is earned:

- **Manual**: You award the badge to students individually

</Step>

<Step title="Choose Certificate Type">
Click **Add Award** and select **Certificate**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Certificate Details">

- **Description**: What the certificate recognizes
</Step>

<Step title="Design the Certificate">
Customize the certificate appearance:

- **Template**: Select from available templates or create a custom design

Example text:
```
This certifies that {FirstName} {LastName} has successfully completed
{CourseName} on {Date}.
```
</Step>

<Step title="Set Award Criteria">
Configure when the certificate is awarded:

- **Manual**: You issue certificates individually
- **Automatic**: Use release conditions (e.g., final grade ≥ 70%)
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Certificate">
Click **Save** to create the certificate.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up Release Conditions for Awards

Automatic awards use release conditions to determine when students earn them.

### Common Release Condition Examples

| Achievement | Release Condition |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Complete all readings | Content topic visited for all items in Module X |
| Pass the course | Final calculated grade ≥ passing threshold |
| Perfect quiz score | Quiz score = 100% |
| Submit all assignments | Assignment submitted for all required assignments |
| Active discussant | Post count in discussion ≥ specified number |

### Creating Compound Conditions

You can require multiple conditions using AND/OR logic:

- **All conditions (AND)**: Student must meet every condition
- **Any condition (OR)**: Student must meet at least one condition

Example: "Earn the 'Course Champion' badge by completing ALL modules AND achieving a final grade of 85% or higher."

<Callout type="warning" title="Condition Timing">
Automatic awards are evaluated when students meet conditions. There may be a slight delay between meeting conditions and receiving the award. Awards are not retroactive—students must meet conditions after the award is created.
</Callout>

## Awarding Badges Manually

For awards without automatic conditions, you grant them manually:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Award">
In the Awards tool, click on the badge or certificate you want to award.
</Step>

<Step title="View Eligible Students">
Click **Award** or **Issue Award** to see the list of students.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Recipients">
Check the boxes next to students who should receive the award.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Evidence (Optional)">
If required, add notes explaining why the student earned the award.
</Step>

<Step title="Issue the Award">
Click **Award** or **Issue** to grant the badge/certificate to selected students.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Awarded Badges

### Viewing Who Has Earned Awards

1. Open the Awards tool
2. Click on an award to see its details
3. View the list of students who have earned it
4. See the date each student earned the award

### Revoking an Award

If an award was given in error:

1. Open the award details
2. Find the student in the awarded list
3. Click **Revoke** or the delete icon
4. Confirm the revocation

<Callout type="info" title="Revocation Visibility">
Students are typically not notified when an award is revoked, but the badge will disappear from their profile.
</Callout>

## Student View of Awards

Students can view their awards in several places:

### Awards Page
Students can access an Awards page showing:
- Badges they've earned
- Badges available in the course
- Progress toward earning badges
- Certificates they can download

### Profile Display
Earned badges may appear on student profiles (depending on institution settings), allowing peers to see achievements.

### Notifications
Students may receive notifications when they earn a badge, encouraging them to continue engaging with the course.

## Best Practices

### Designing Effective Awards

- **Make them meaningful**: Award badges for genuine achievements, not trivial tasks
- **Be specific**: "Completed Week 3 Module" is better than "Participation"
- **Use clear icons**: Choose visuals that represent the achievement
- **Write good descriptions**: Help students understand what the badge represents

### Strategic Implementation

- **Start small**: Begin with a few key awards rather than overwhelming students
- **Balance effort and reward**: Higher achievements should have more prestigious awards
- **Consider optional content**: Badges work well for incentivizing supplemental materials
- **Communicate the system**: Explain to students what awards are available and how to earn them

### What to Award

**Good candidates for badges:**
- Module completion
- Perfect scores on assessments
- Active discussion participation
- Submitting work early
- Completing optional enrichment content
- Peer helping (if you can track it)

**Good candidates for certificates:**
- Course completion
- Achieving honors/distinction
- Completing a certificate program
- Significant milestones

<Callout type="tip" title="Student Input">
Consider asking students what achievements they'd like recognized. Awards are most motivating when students value earning them.
</Callout>

## Integrating Awards with Course Design

### Gamification Strategy

If using multiple awards, consider a cohesive system:

1. **Tiered badges**: Bronze, Silver, Gold levels for progressive achievement
2. **Category badges**: Different badge types for different skills (writing, analysis, collaboration)
3. **Unlockable content**: Use badges as release conditions for bonus content
4. **Leaderboard**: Some institutions enable badge leaderboards (check privacy implications)

### Combining with Other Tools

- **Release Conditions**: Unlock content when students earn certain badges
- **Intelligent Agents**: Send congratulations when badges are earned
- **Gradebook**: While badges don't directly affect grades, you can create a participation grade that considers badge earning
- **Class Progress**: Monitor which students are engaging with badge-worthy activities

## Common Issues

### Award Not Being Granted Automatically

- Verify release conditions are set correctly
- Check that the award is set to "Available"
- Ensure the student hasn't already earned the award (if it's one-time only)
- Release conditions may have a processing delay

### Students Can't See Awards

- Confirm the Awards tool is available to students in your course
- Check that specific awards are set to "Available"
- Verify the Awards page or widget is accessible from student navigation

### Certificate Not Printing Correctly

- Check the certificate template for proper formatting
- Verify merge fields are correctly formatted
- Test by awarding yourself (if possible) or previewing the certificate
- Try a different browser if display issues persist
