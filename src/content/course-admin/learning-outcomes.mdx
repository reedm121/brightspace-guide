# Learning Outcomes

## Overview

**Learning Outcomes** (also called competencies or objectives in some Brightspace configurations) allow you to define what students should know or be able to do by the end of your course, and then align course activities to those outcomes. This creates a clear connection between learning goals and assessments, helping both instructors and students understand how each activity contributes to overall learning.

<Callout type="info" title="Terminology Note">
Brightspace uses different terms depending on your institution's configuration: Learning Outcomes, Competencies, Objectives, or Standards. They all refer to the same feature. This guide uses "Learning Outcomes" throughout.
</Callout>

## Why Use Learning Outcomes?

Learning outcomes serve several purposes:

| Purpose | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | Students know exactly what they're expected to learn |
| **Alignment** | Connect assessments to specific learning goals |
| **Accreditation** | Document how courses meet program or institutional requirements |
| **Curriculum Mapping** | Track how outcomes are addressed across a program |
| **Assessment Analysis** | Identify which outcomes students are achieving |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Use data to refine teaching and assessment |

<Callout type="tip" title="Backward Design">
Learning outcomes support "backward design"—starting with what students should learn, then designing assessments and activities to achieve those goals.
</Callout>

## Accessing Learning Outcomes

To access the Learning Outcomes tool:

1. Go to **Course Admin** in your course navbar
2. Look for **Learning Outcomes**, **Competencies**, or **Course Objectives**
3. Click to open the outcomes management area

<Callout type="warning" title="Administrator Setup Required">
Learning outcomes are often managed at the program or institutional level. Your ability to create, edit, or align outcomes depends on permissions set by your administrator.
</Callout>

## Understanding the Outcomes Structure

Learning outcomes in Brightspace can be organized hierarchically:

```
Program Outcomes (Organization level)
└── Course Outcomes
    └── Module/Unit Outcomes
        └── Specific Learning Objectives
```

### Outcome Levels

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Program** | "Graduates will communicate effectively in professional settings" |
| **Course** | "Students will write clear, well-organized reports" |
| **Module** | "Students will structure a report with introduction, body, and conclusion" |
| **Specific** | "Students will write effective topic sentences" |

## Creating Learning Outcomes

If you have permission to create outcomes:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Learning Outcomes">
Go to **Course Admin** > **Learning Outcomes** and click **New Outcome** or **Create**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Outcome Details">
- **Name/Title**: A brief identifier
- **Description**: The full outcome statement (what students will know/do)
- **Parent Outcome** (optional): Link to a higher-level outcome
</Step>

<Step title="Add Achievement Levels (Optional)">
Define what different levels of mastery look like:
- **Exemplary**: Exceeds expectations
- **Accomplished**: Meets expectations
- **Developing**: Approaching expectations
- **Beginning**: Does not yet meet expectations
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Outcome">
Click **Save** to create the outcome.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Writing Effective Learning Outcomes

Good learning outcomes are:

- **Specific**: Clearly state what students will learn
- **Measurable**: Can be assessed through activities
- **Action-oriented**: Use verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy
- **Student-focused**: Describe what students will do, not what instructors teach

**Bloom's Taxonomy Verbs by Level:**

| Level | Verbs |
|-------|-------|
| **Remember** | Define, list, identify, recall, name |
| **Understand** | Explain, summarize, interpret, classify |
| **Apply** | Use, demonstrate, solve, implement |
| **Analyze** | Compare, contrast, examine, differentiate |
| **Evaluate** | Judge, critique, assess, justify |
| **Create** | Design, develop, construct, produce |

**Example outcomes:**
- ❌ "Students will understand statistics" (too vague)
- ✅ "Students will calculate and interpret descriptive statistics including mean, median, and standard deviation"

## Aligning Activities to Outcomes

Once outcomes are created, align them to course activities to show how each activity contributes to learning.

### What Can Be Aligned

You can align outcomes to:
- Assignments
- Quizzes
- Discussion topics
- Rubric criteria
- Content items
- Grade items

### Aligning an Assignment to Outcomes

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Assignment">
Go to **Assignments** and edit the assignment you want to align.
</Step>

<Step title="Find Learning Outcomes Section">
Look for **Learning Outcomes**, **Competencies**, or **Align to Outcomes** in the assignment settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Outcomes">
Browse or search for outcomes and check those that this assignment assesses.
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Assignment">
Save your changes. The assignment is now linked to the selected outcomes.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Aligning Rubric Criteria to Outcomes

For more precise alignment, connect specific rubric criteria to outcomes:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Rubric">
Go to **Course Admin** > **Rubrics** and edit your rubric.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit a Criterion">
Click on a rubric criterion/row.
</Step>

<Step title="Align to Outcomes">
Find the learning outcomes option and select the outcome(s) this criterion assesses.
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Rubric">
Repeat for other criteria and save the rubric.
</Step>
</Steps>

This creates granular alignment—when you assess a student using that rubric criterion, the outcome achievement is recorded.

## Viewing Outcome Achievement

### Class-Level View

See how your class is performing on outcomes:

1. Go to **Course Admin** > **Learning Outcomes**
2. Click **Class Progress** or **Outcome Achievement**
3. View a summary showing:
   - Each outcome
   - Number of students who have demonstrated achievement
   - Average achievement level
   - Trend over time

### Student-Level View

See individual student outcome achievement:

1. Access the individual student's progress (via Class Progress or Grades)
2. Look for a Learning Outcomes or Competencies tab
3. View which outcomes the student has demonstrated mastery of
4. See which activities contributed to that assessment

### Student Self-View

Students can typically see their own outcome progress:

1. Students access their progress summary
2. They see which learning outcomes they've achieved
3. They can identify areas needing more work

<Callout type="tip" title="Student Awareness">
Point students to their outcome progress early in the semester. Understanding how their work connects to learning goals can increase motivation and focus.
</Callout>

## Outcome Reports

Generate reports for accreditation or program review:

### Course Outcome Report

Shows outcome achievement for your course:
- Percentage of students achieving each outcome
- Distribution across achievement levels
- Alignment map (which activities assess which outcomes)

### Generating Reports

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Outcomes">
Go to **Course Admin** > **Learning Outcomes**.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Report Type">
Click **Reports** or **Export** and choose the report type.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Report Settings">
- Select date range
- Choose which outcomes to include
- Select output format (PDF, CSV, Excel)
</Step>

<Step title="Generate and Download">
Click **Generate** and download the report.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Mapping Outcomes Across a Program

If your institution uses outcomes at the program level, you can see how course outcomes map to larger program outcomes:

### Curriculum Mapping

- **Introduced**: Outcome is first introduced in this course
- **Reinforced**: Outcome is practiced and developed
- **Mastered**: Outcome is expected to be fully achieved

This helps identify:
- Gaps where outcomes aren't addressed
- Redundancies where outcomes are over-assessed
- Appropriate progression through the curriculum

## Best Practices

### For Outcome Design

- **Start with the end in mind**: What should students be able to do after completing your course?
- **Keep it manageable**: 5-8 major outcomes per course is typical
- **Involve stakeholders**: Align with program requirements and employer needs
- **Review periodically**: Update outcomes as fields evolve

### For Alignment

- **Align purposefully**: Not every activity needs to align to an outcome
- **Ensure coverage**: Each outcome should have multiple assessment opportunities
- **Use rubrics**: Rubric alignment provides the most detailed data
- **Check balance**: Don't over-assess some outcomes while ignoring others

### For Assessment

- **Multiple measures**: Assess each outcome through different activity types
- **Provide feedback**: Help students understand their progress toward outcomes
- **Use data**: Review outcome reports to improve teaching
- **Document for accreditation**: Maintain records of outcome achievement

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid Over-Alignment">
Aligning every activity to every outcome dilutes the data. Be strategic—align activities that genuinely assess the outcome, not peripherally related ones.
</Callout>

## Integration with Other Tools

### Grades Integration

- Outcome achievement can be displayed alongside or separate from grades
- Some institutions use outcome-based grading (competency-based education)
- Achievement levels can map to grade thresholds

### Class Progress Integration

- View outcome progress alongside other engagement metrics
- Identify students struggling with specific outcomes
- Combine with Intelligent Agents for automated interventions

### ePortfolios

If your institution uses ePortfolios:
- Students can link work to outcomes
- Create outcome-aligned showcases
- Demonstrate achievement to employers or graduate programs

## Common Issues

### Can't Create or Edit Outcomes

- Outcomes may be managed at the program/institution level
- Check with your administrator about your permissions
- You may only be able to align to pre-created outcomes

### Alignment Not Showing in Reports

- Verify the activity is properly aligned
- Check that students have submitted work to that activity
- Reports may have a delay in updating

### Students Can't See Their Outcome Progress

- Verify outcome display is enabled for students
- Check institutional settings for outcome visibility
- Some institutions restrict student access to outcome data

### Outcomes From Copied Course Not Working

- Outcomes may not copy between courses
- You may need to re-align activities after copying
- Check if outcomes are course-level or organization-level
