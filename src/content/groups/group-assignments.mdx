# Group Assignments

## Overview

Group assignments in Brightspace allow students to work collaboratively and submit a single assignment on behalf of their entire team. When one group member submits, all members can view the submission, and when you grade it, all members receive the same grade automatically. This guide covers everything you need to know about setting up, managing, and grading group assignments effectively.

## Before You Begin

- You must have Instructor or TA permissions in the course
- **Groups must be created first** using the Groups tool before you can create a group assignment
- Groups should be organized into Group Categories (assignments link to categories, not individual groups)
- Decide whether all group members will receive the same grade or if you need to assign individual grades
- Consider whether you want to use peer evaluation for group work

<Callout type="warning" title="Create Groups First">
You cannot create a group assignment without first setting up groups in your course. Navigate to **Tools** > **Groups** and create your group category and groups before proceeding.
</Callout>

## Setting Up Group Assignments

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Assignments">
From your course navbar, click **Assessments** and select **Assignments** from the dropdown menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new assignment">
Click the **New Assignment** button at the top of the page.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter assignment details">
Configure the basic assignment information:
- **Name**: Enter a clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Group Project: Research Paper")
- **Grade Out Of**: Set the maximum points for the assignment
- **Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions for the group assignment, including expectations for collaboration
</Step>

<Step title="Expand Submission & Completion settings">
Click on **Submission & Completion** to expand the panel. This is where you configure the assignment as a group submission.
</Step>

<Step title="Change Assignment Type to Group">
Under **Assignment Type**, change the selection from "Individual Assignment" to **Group Assignment**.
</Step>

<Step title="Select the Group Category">
A **Category** dropdown will appear. Select the group category containing the groups that should complete this assignment.

<Callout type="info" title="One Category Per Assignment">
Each assignment can only be linked to one group category. If you have multiple group categories (e.g., "Project Teams" and "Discussion Groups"), you can only select one. All groups within that category will have access to submit to this assignment.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure submission options">
Set any additional submission preferences:
- **Files Allowed Per Submission**: Choose unlimited or limit to one file
- **Submission File Types**: Restrict to specific file types if needed
</Step>

<Step title="Set availability dates">
Configure the **Start Date**, **Due Date**, and optionally an **End Date** to control when groups can access and submit the assignment.
</Step>

<Step title="Save the assignment">
Click **Save and Close** to create the group assignment. Toggle the visibility to make it available to students when ready.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Linking Assignments to Group Categories

Understanding how assignments connect to groups is essential for proper setup:

### The Category-Assignment Relationship

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Group Category** | A container holding related groups (e.g., "Project Teams") |
| **Groups** | Individual teams within the category (e.g., "Team 1", "Team 2") |
| **Group Assignment** | An assignment linked to an entire category, accessible by all groups within it |

<Callout type="tip" title="Planning Your Group Categories">
If you need different groups for different assignments throughout the semester, create separate group categories for each. For example:
- "Midterm Project Teams" - for the midterm group assignment
- "Final Presentation Groups" - for the final group presentation
- "Lab Partners" - for weekly lab assignments
</Callout>

### Linking to an Existing Assignment

If you need to convert an existing individual assignment to a group assignment:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the assignment for editing">
Go to **Assignments**, click on the assignment name to open it.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Submission settings">
Expand the **Submission & Completion** panel.
</Step>

<Step title="Change to Group Assignment">
Change the **Assignment Type** from "Individual Assignment" to "Group Assignment" and select the appropriate group category.
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
Click **Save and Close** to apply the changes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Changing Assignment Type">
Be cautious when changing an existing individual assignment to a group assignment if students have already submitted. Existing individual submissions will remain, but new submissions will be handled as group submissions.
</Callout>

## How Group Submissions Work

### The Submission Process

When a group assignment is active:

1. **Any group member can submit** - One person submits on behalf of the entire group
2. **All members see the submission** - Every group member can view and download what was submitted
3. **Only one submission per group** - The most recent submission replaces any previous ones
4. **Late indicators apply to the group** - If submitted late, all members see the late status

### What Students See

- Students see the assignment with their group name displayed
- They can view which group member made the submission
- All group members receive notifications about submission status
- Group feedback is visible to all members

### Resubmitting

If allowed, any group member can resubmit to replace the previous submission. The new submission becomes the active one for the entire group.

## Grading Group Work

### Grading All Members the Same

When you want all group members to receive identical grades (the most common scenario):

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the assignment">
Go to **Assignments** and click on your group assignment.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a group to evaluate">
You will see groups listed rather than individual students. Click **Evaluate** next to the group you want to grade.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the submission">
View the submitted file(s) in the document viewer. You can annotate directly on the document.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter the grade">
Enter the score in the **Grade** field. This grade will be applied to all group members.
</Step>

<Step title="Provide feedback">
Add written feedback in the **Feedback** area. All group members will see this feedback.
</Step>

<Step title="Publish the grade">
Click **Publish** to release the grade and feedback to all group members, or **Save Draft** to save without publishing.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Automatic Grade Distribution">
When you publish a grade for a group assignment through the Assignments tool, all group members automatically receive the same grade and feedback. There is no need to enter grades multiple times.
</Callout>

## Individual vs. Group Grades

Sometimes you need to assign different grades to group members based on individual contributions. Brightspace supports this through a two-step process.

### When to Use Individual Grades

- One member contributed significantly more than others
- A student joined the group late or left early
- Peer evaluations indicate unequal participation
- One member did not meet expectations despite the group's overall success

### Assigning Individual Grades

<Steps>
<Step title="First, grade the group submission">
Use the Assignments tool to grade the submission as normal. Enter the base grade that most members will receive and publish it.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to the Gradebook">
Go to **Assessments** > **Grades** from the course navbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Access the grade item">
Find the grade item linked to the group assignment. Click the dropdown arrow next to it and select **Enter Grades**.
</Step>

<Step title="Filter by groups (optional)">
To focus on specific groups, use the **View By** dropdown and select **Groups**. Choose the relevant group category and click **Apply**.
</Step>

<Step title="Modify individual grades">
Locate the students who need different grades and change their scores directly in the grade column.
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
Click **Save** to apply the individual grade modifications.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Grade Display Discrepancy">
When you override individual grades in the Gradebook, students may see both the original group grade (in Assignments) and their individual grade (in Grades). To avoid confusion, inform students that their official grade is in the Gradebook, not the Assignments tool.
</Callout>

### Providing Individual Feedback

To provide individual feedback alongside individual grades:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Enter Grades">
In the Gradebook, click the dropdown next to your grade item and select **Enter Grades**.
</Step>

<Step title="Click on the student's grade cell">
Click directly on the grade cell for the student you want to add individual feedback to.
</Step>

<Step title="Add feedback">
Enter individual comments in the feedback field. This feedback is only visible to that specific student.
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
Click **Save** to apply the individual feedback.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Peer Evaluation Options

Brightspace does not have a built-in peer evaluation tool, but there are several options for gathering peer feedback on group work.

### Third-Party Integration Tools

Many institutions integrate specialized peer evaluation tools with Brightspace:

| Tool | Features |
|------|----------|
| **peerScholar** | Students submit as groups and peer assess other groups; structured feedback with rubrics |
| **FeedbackFruits** | Automated peer review matching; rubric-based feedback; grades sync to Brightspace gradebook |
| **TEAMMATES** | Free peer evaluation tool for team projects |

<Callout type="tip" title="Check with Your Institution">
Contact your institution's LMS support team to see which peer evaluation tools are integrated with your Brightspace instance.
</Callout>

### Discussion-Based Peer Evaluation

If third-party tools are unavailable, you can create a peer evaluation workflow using Discussions:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a group category for peer evaluation">
Set up groups specifically for the peer evaluation process using the Groups tool.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a private discussion forum">
In **Discussions**, create a forum with restricted access. Enable **Group Discussions** so each group has a private space.
</Step>

<Step title="Post evaluation prompts">
Provide clear questions for students to reflect on each team member's contributions:
- How did each member contribute to the project?
- What were each person's strengths?
- How could collaboration be improved?
</Step>

<Step title="Review responses">
Access each group's discussion to review peer feedback before finalizing individual grades.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Self-Assessment Options

Consider having students complete a self-assessment alongside peer evaluations:

- Create a quiz with reflection questions about their own contributions
- Use a text submission assignment for written self-reflection
- Attach a rubric for students to self-evaluate their participation

## Group Assignment Folders

### Understanding Group Submission Folders

When you create a group assignment, Brightspace automatically handles submission folders at the group level:

- Each group has a virtual "folder" for their submissions
- All group members can access their group's submission folder
- Instructors see all group folders and can access any submission

### Setting Up Group-Specific Dropboxes

If you enabled "Set up assignment submission folders" when creating your group category, each group automatically has a dedicated assignment folder.

To add this after the fact:

<Steps>
<Step title="Edit the group category">
Go to **Tools** > **Groups**, click the dropdown arrow next to your category, and select **Edit Category**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable assignment folders">
Under **Additional Options**, check **Set up assignment submission folders**.
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
Click **Save** to create assignment folders for all groups in the category.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Organizing Multiple Group Assignments

For courses with multiple group assignments, consider these organizational strategies:

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Use categories** | Create assignment categories to group related group assignments together |
| **Clear naming** | Include the group category name in assignment titles (e.g., "Project Teams - Milestone 1") |
| **Sequential numbering** | Use numbers or dates in assignment names for chronological ordering |

## Managing Group Conflicts

### When Students Need to Change Groups

Group conflicts are common. Here is how to handle various scenarios:

#### Moving a Student to a Different Group

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Groups">
Navigate to **Tools** > **Groups**.
</Step>

<Step title="Select the category">
Choose the group category from the dropdown.
</Step>

<Step title="Access enrollment">
Click the dropdown arrow next to the category and select **Enroll Users**.
</Step>

<Step title="Modify group membership">
- **Remove from old group**: Uncheck the box next to the student's name for their current group
- **Add to new group**: Check the box next to the student's name for their new group
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
Click **Save** to apply the changes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Impact on Prior Work">
When you move a student between groups:
- **Previous submissions** stay with the old group
- **Previous grades** from the old group remain unchanged
- The student receives **future grades** from their new group
- **Discussion posts** in group discussions remain with the old group

Plan moves carefully, especially mid-project.
</Callout>

### Handling Dropped or Withdrawn Students

Students who withdraw from the course may still appear in groups. To clean up:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check your classlist">
Compare the Groups enrollment list against your official Classlist to identify withdrawn students.
</Step>

<Step title="Remove withdrawn students">
Access the group enrollment and uncheck withdrawn students to remove them from groups.
</Step>

<Step title="Redistribute if needed">
If removing a student leaves a group too small, consider redistributing members or merging groups.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Resolving Uneven Groups

If groups become unbalanced:

- **Manually move students** using the enrollment feature
- **Allow manual override** of group capacity limits when necessary
- **Create new groups** within the category if needed
- **Merge small groups** by moving all members to one group

### Students Not in Any Group

For students who missed self-enrollment or were not assigned:

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify unassigned students">
In the Groups tool, look for the "Users without a group" option or cross-reference with your classlist.
</Step>

<Step title="Assign manually">
Add them to an existing group with space, or create a new group if needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable auto-allocation (for self-enrollment)">
When setting up self-enrollment, enable **Allocate unenrolled users** to automatically assign students who miss the deadline.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Group Assignments

### Before the Assignment

1. **Create groups early** - Set up groups before creating assignments
2. **Communicate group membership** - Ensure students know their groups and can contact teammates
3. **Set clear expectations** - Define collaboration requirements, individual responsibilities, and how grades will be assigned
4. **Plan for conflicts** - Have a policy for handling group issues and communicate it upfront

### During the Assignment

1. **Monitor progress** - Check in with groups periodically
2. **Provide interim feedback** - Consider milestone submissions for long projects
3. **Address issues promptly** - Handle group conflicts or non-participating members early
4. **Keep records** - Document any group changes or special circumstances

### When Grading

1. **Use rubrics** - Attach rubrics to provide consistent, transparent grading criteria
2. **Consider individual contributions** - Use peer evaluations or reflections to inform individual grades if needed
3. **Provide group-level feedback** - Comment on collaboration and teamwork, not just content
4. **Be transparent about grade modifications** - If giving different grades to group members, explain why to affected students

<Callout type="tip" title="Setting Expectations">
Include clear statements in your syllabus and assignment instructions about:
- How group grades will be determined
- What happens if a member does not contribute
- How peer evaluations will be used
- Your policy for handling group conflicts
</Callout>

### Technical Tips

1. **Test submissions yourself** - Submit a test file to verify the group assignment is configured correctly
2. **Link to gradebook early** - Connect the assignment to a grade item when creating it
3. **Use due dates wisely** - Set due dates to trigger reminders; use end dates to cut off submissions
4. **Verify group membership** - Double-check that all students are assigned to groups before the assignment opens

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Cannot select Group Assignment type | Groups must be created first in the Groups tool |
| Assignment shows for some groups but not others | Verify all groups are in the selected category; check release conditions |
| Student cannot see group submission | Confirm the student is enrolled in the correct group |
| Grade not appearing for all members | Publish the grade from Assignments tool; check gradebook sync |
| Need to give different grades to members | Grade in Assignments first, then override in Gradebook |
| Student changed groups mid-assignment | Previous submissions stay with old group; manually handle grading |
| Group assignment linked to wrong category | Edit the assignment and select the correct category |
