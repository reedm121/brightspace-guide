# Creating and Managing Groups

## Overview

Groups in Brightspace allow you to organize students into smaller clusters within your course for collaborative projects, discussions, and assignments. This guide covers everything you need to know about creating, configuring, and managing groups effectively.

## Before You Begin

- You need Instructor or TA permissions in the course
- Decide on your group structure (size, enrollment method, workspaces needed)
- Consider whether students should self-enroll or be assigned automatically/manually

## Understanding Group Categories vs Groups

In Brightspace, groups are organized using a two-level hierarchy:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Group Category** | A container that holds related groups and defines their settings (enrollment type, size, workspaces) |
| **Group** | An individual team of students within a category |

<Callout type="info" title="Example">
If you have a course project where students work in teams of 4, you would create a Group Category called "Project Teams" containing individual groups like "Team 1", "Team 2", etc.
</Callout>

Students can belong to multiple groups across different categories in the same course. For example, a student could be in "Project Team 3" and also in "Discussion Group A".

## Creating a Group Category

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Groups tool">
From your course navbar, click **Tools** and select **Groups** from the dropdown menu. This opens the Manage Groups page.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new category">
Click the **New Category** button at the top of the page.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter category details">
1. Enter a **Category Name** (e.g., "Project Teams", "Lab Groups", "Study Groups")
2. Optionally add a **Description** to explain the purpose of these groups
</Step>

<Step title="Select an enrollment type">
Choose how students will be assigned to groups from the **Enrollment Type** dropdown. See the next section for detailed explanations of each option.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure additional options">
Select any workspaces you want to create for the groups:
- **Set up discussion areas** - Creates a private discussion topic for each group
- **Set up lockers** - Creates a shared file storage space for each group
- **Set up assignment submission folders** - Creates a group assignment dropbox

These options can also be added later by editing the category.
</Step>

<Step title="Save the category">
Click **Save** to create the category and its groups.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Enrollment Types Explained

Brightspace offers several enrollment types to accommodate different teaching scenarios:

### Manual Enrollment Options

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **# of Groups - No Auto Enrollment** | Creates a specified number of empty groups for you to fill manually | When you want complete control over group composition |

### Automatic Enrollment Options

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Groups of #** | Creates groups with a maximum number of students; Brightspace assigns students automatically | When group size matters more than the number of groups |
| **# of Groups** | Creates a specified number of groups; students are distributed automatically | When you need a specific number of groups |

<Callout type="tip" title="Advanced Properties for Automatic Enrollment">
When using automatic enrollment types, you can configure:
- **Auto-enroll new users**: Automatically adds late-joining students to groups
- **Randomize users in groups**: Assigns students randomly instead of alphabetically
</Callout>

### Self-Enrollment Options

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Groups of # - Self Enrollment** | Students choose their group; maximum size per group is enforced | When students should form their own teams with size limits |
| **# of Groups - Self Enrollment** | Students choose from a fixed number of groups | When you need a specific number of teams |
| **# of Groups, Capacity of # - Self Enrollment** | Students choose from fixed groups with a capacity limit | When you need specific numbers of both groups and students per group |

### Special Options

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Single user, member-specific groups** | Creates individual groups named after each student | Peer review or individual project tracking |

## Configuring Self-Enrollment Settings

When using self-enrollment options, you can configure additional restrictions:

<Steps>
<Step title="Set enrollment period">
Define when students can enroll:
- **Start Date**: When self-enrollment opens (select "Now" for immediate access)
- **Expiry Date**: When self-enrollment closes

Students cannot join or leave groups outside this window.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure unenrolled user handling">
Enable **Allocate unenrolled users** to automatically assign students who did not choose a group after the enrollment deadline passes.

<Callout type="warning" title="Note">
When unenrolled users are automatically allocated, group capacity limits may be exceeded.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Make groups visible">

## Common Issues

### Cannot change group size after creation
Group size cannot be modified after a category is created. However, you can manually add students beyond the capacity limit. Plan your group sizes carefully before creation.

### Self-enrollment capacity changes
For self-enrollment groups only, the capacity can be changed before the sign-up expiry date.

### Students in wrong groups
Use the Enroll Users feature to manually move students. Remember that prior work (discussions, submissions) stays with the original group.

### Group workspaces not appearing
Edit the category and enable the desired workspaces (discussions, lockers, assignments). They can be added after initial creation.
