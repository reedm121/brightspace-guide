# Copying Courses Between Terms

## Overview

When a new semester begins, you don't need to rebuild your course from scratch. Brightspace's Import/Export/Copy Components tool allows you to copy content from a previous course into a new course shell, saving hours of setup time. This guide covers how to copy courses effectively, manage dates, and avoid common pitfalls.

## Before You Begin

- You must have **Instructor** role access in both the source course (the one you're copying from) and the destination course (the one you're copying to)
- Use **Chrome or Firefox** for copying courses (Safari may cause issues with the copy process)
- Wait for any requested course merges to complete before copying
- Have both course start dates handy if you plan to offset dates

<Callout type="warning" title="No Undo Available">
There is no way to reverse the copy process once you submit the request. Always double-check that you are in the correct destination course and have selected the correct source course before proceeding.
</Callout>

## When to Copy vs. Create New

### Copy Your Course When:
- Teaching the same course in a new term
- Reusing content, assignments, quizzes, and rubrics from a previous offering
- Setting up multiple sections of the same course
- Transferring materials from a development course to a live course

### Create New When:
- Starting a completely new course design
- The previous course structure needs major overhaul
- You want a fresh start without any legacy content

<Callout type="tip" title="Copy All for Complex Courses">
If your course uses extensive release conditions, grade item associations, or group restrictions, copying all components at once preserves these connections. Copying items individually may break these links.
</Callout>

## Course Components You Can Copy

When copying a course, you can choose to copy all components or select specific items:

| Component | What Copies | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Content** | Modules, topics, HTML pages, files | Core course structure |
| **Assignments** | Assignment folders, settings, instructions | Turnitin settings reset to default |
| **Quizzes** | Quizzes, questions, settings | Question randomization preserved |
| **Question Library** | All question pools and categories | Keeps question organization |
| **Discussions** | Forums, topics, settings | Student posts do NOT copy |
| **Grades** | Grade items, categories | Student grades do NOT copy |
| **Grade Settings** | Calculation methods, preferences | Weighted vs. points settings |
| **Rubrics** | All rubrics and criteria | Maintains grade associations |
| **Intelligent Agents** | Agent rules and criteria | Agents are disabled after copy |
| **Checklists** | Checklist items and categories | Student progress does NOT copy |
| **Course Homepage** | Homepage layout and widgets | Only copies with "Copy All" |

## What Does NOT Copy

Student-specific data is never copied between courses:

- **Class lists** - Student enrollments stay with the original course
- **Student grades** - All gradebook entries for students
- **Assignment submissions** - Files students have submitted
- **Discussion posts** - Student contributions to forums
- **Quiz attempts** - Student quiz submissions and scores
- **Release conditions for specific users** - Special access settings
- **Calendar events** - Manually added calendar entries

<Callout type="info" title="Student Data Protection">
This is by design. Each course offering should start fresh with no previous student data. If you need to retain student work, export it separately before the term ends.
</Callout>

## Copying a Course: Step by Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the destination course">
Log into Brightspace and enter the **new course shell** where you want the content copied TO. This is crucial - you must be in the destination course, not the source course.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Course Admin">
Click **Course Admin** in the course navbar. If you don't see this option, look for **Course Tools** or a gear icon.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Import/Export/Copy Components">
On the Course Administration page, locate and click **Import/Export/Copy Components** under the Site Resources section.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Copy Components from another Org Unit">
Select the **Copy Components from another Org Unit** option and click **Search for offering**.
</Step>

<Step title="Find your source course">
In the Select Course Offering window:
- Enter the course code, name, or CRN from your source course
- Click **Search**
- Select the checkbox next to the correct course
- Click **Add Selected**
</Step>

<Step title="Choose what to copy">
You have two options:

**Copy All Components** - Recommended for most cases
- Copies everything including homepage layout
- Preserves release conditions and grade associations
- Fastest option

**Select Components** - For selective copying
- Choose specific items to copy
- Useful when merging content from multiple courses
- May require manual linking afterward
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for the copy to complete">
A progress indicator will show the copy status. For large courses, this may take several minutes. Do not navigate away until the process completes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid Copying Announcements">
Deselect Announcements when copying components. Copied announcements may trigger email notifications to students enrolled in the destination course, potentially revealing content before you're ready.
</Callout>

## Offsetting Dates After Copying

When you copy a course from a previous term, all dates (due dates, availability dates, end dates) copy with their original values. You'll need to adjust these for the new term.

### Using the Manage Dates Tool

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Manage Dates">
After copying, go to **Course Admin** and click **Manage Dates** under the Site Resources section.
</Step>

<Step title="View all dated items">
You'll see a list of all items with dates across your course - assignments, quizzes, discussions, content topics, and more.
</Step>

<Step title="Select items to offset">
Check the boxes next to items you want to update. You can:
- Select all items at once
- Filter by tool type (Assignments, Quizzes, etc.) using the **Filter by Tool** option
- Click **Apply Filter** after making your selection
</Step>

<Step title="Click Bulk Offset Dates">
With your items selected, click the **Bulk Offset Dates** button.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose date types to offset">
Select which dates to adjust:
- **Due Date** - When work is due
- **Start Date** - When items become available
- **End Date** - When items are no longer accessible
- **Other activity dates** - Additional tool-specific dates
</Step>

<Step title="Calculate the offset">
Choose **Calculate range between two dates** (recommended):
- In the **From** field, enter the start date of your source course (e.g., the first day of the previous semester)
- In the **To** field, enter the start date of your destination course (e.g., the first day of the new semester)
- Brightspace calculates the exact offset needed
</Step>

<Step title="Save and apply">
Review the calculated offset, then click **Save**. Brightspace will update all selected dates automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Verify Critical Dates">
After bulk offsetting, manually verify important dates like exam availability windows and assignment deadlines. Double-check that dates don't fall on weekends or holidays.
</Callout>

## Special Considerations

### Turnitin Assignments

Turnitin settings reset to default when copied. After copying:

1. Go to **Assignments** in your destination course
2. Click **Enable** in the top right corner to regenerate Turnitin connections
3. Verify Turnitin settings on each assignment

<Callout type="warning" title="PeerMark Does Not Copy">
PeerMark assignments cannot be copied via the course copy process. You must recreate PeerMark assignments manually in your destination course.
</Callout>

### Intelligent Agents

All Intelligent Agents are **disabled by default** after copying. To enable them:

1. Go to **Course Admin > Intelligent Agents**
2. Click on each agent you want to use
3. Toggle the agent to **Enabled**
4. Verify the agent criteria and actions are correct for the new term

### Respondus LockDown Browser

If your quizzes use Respondus LockDown Browser:

1. After copying, access the **Respondus LockDown Browser Dashboard** from Course Admin
2. This updates the RLDB settings for the destination course
3. Students cannot take RLDB-enabled exams until you complete this step

### Third-Party Integrations

These items typically do NOT copy and require manual setup:

- **VoiceThread** links
- **Echo360** video links
- **Publisher content** (McGraw Hill, Pearson, etc.)
- **External LTI tools** may need reconfiguration

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Cannot Find Source Course

- Verify you have Instructor access in the source course
- Try searching by course code instead of course name
- Contact your IT department if the course isn't appearing

### Duplicated Content

If you run the copy process multiple times, content will be duplicated:

- Delete duplicate items manually
- Exception: Course files with the same name are overwritten, not duplicated

### Broken Links and Associations

If you copy components individually rather than all at once:

- Grade item associations may be broken - manually link items to grade items
- Release conditions may need to be reattached
- Group associations may need to be recreated

### Items Still Showing Old Dates

- Use **Manage Dates** to find items with incorrect dates
- Some tool-specific dates may need manual adjustment
- Check availability windows in addition to due dates

### Copy Process Fails or Times Out

- Try copying fewer components at a time
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Use a wired internet connection for large courses
- Contact IT support if issues persist

## Best Practices for Course Reuse

### Before the Term Ends

1. **Clean up your source course** - Remove outdated content, fix any issues
2. **Document your course structure** - Note any special configurations
3. **Export student data** if needed for records

### When Copying

1. **Use Chrome or Firefox** - Safari can cause issues
2. **Copy all at once** for complex courses with release conditions
3. **Skip Announcements** to avoid accidental emails
4. **Verify the source course** before clicking submit

### After Copying

1. **Offset dates immediately** using Manage Dates
2. **Check homepage layout** - ensure widgets display correctly
3. **Enable Intelligent Agents** if using them
4. **Update Turnitin** connections
5. **Verify external tool links** (publisher content, videos)
6. **Review visibility settings** - all visible items remain visible
7. **Test as a student** - use Student View to verify the course experience

<Callout type="tip" title="Create a Checklist">
Create a post-copy checklist for yourself with all the items you need to verify. This ensures consistency each time you copy a course.
</Callout>

## Common Issues

### Can I copy from multiple courses into one?

Yes, you can run the copy process multiple times from different source courses. Be aware that running multiple copies can create duplicate items if components have the same names.

### Will my course homepage copy?

Yes, but only if you select **Copy All Components**. If you copy individual components, the homepage layout does not transfer.

### Can I copy to multiple destination courses at once?

No, you must copy to one destination course at a time. However, you can repeat the process for each destination course using the same source.
