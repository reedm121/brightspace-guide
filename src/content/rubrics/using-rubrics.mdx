# Attaching and Using Rubrics

## Overview

Once you have created a rubric in Brightspace, you can attach it to assignments, discussions, and quizzes to standardize your grading process. This guide covers how to attach rubrics to different activity types, grade student work using rubrics, and manage how scores transfer to the gradebook.

## Before You Begin

- Ensure your rubric is **published** (Draft rubrics cannot be attached to activities)
- Verify that your rubric point values match the activity's "Grade Out Of" value
- Decide whether you want to use the rubric score or set an overall score manually
- Consider whether students should see the rubric before submitting their work

<Callout type="warning" title="Points Must Match">
Adding a rubric does NOT automatically sync to the "Grade Out Of" field for assignments, discussions, or grade items. Always verify that your rubric's total points match the activity's point value, as Brightspace will not warn you if they differ.
</Callout>

## Attaching Rubrics to Assignments

The most common use for rubrics is grading assignment submissions. Attaching a rubric to an assignment allows you to evaluate student work systematically and provide detailed feedback.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your assignment">
Go to **Activities > Assignments** in your course navbar and locate the assignment you want to add a rubric to.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit the assignment">
Click the arrow next to the assignment name and select **Edit Assignment**, or click directly on the assignment title to open it for editing.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Evaluation and Feedback">
In the assignment editor, look for the **Evaluation & Feedback** section in the right panel.
</Step>

<Step title="Add a rubric">
Click **Add Rubric**, then select **Add Existing** from the dropdown menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Select your rubric">
In the Add Existing Rubric popup window:
1. Browse the list of available published rubrics
2. Select the checkbox next to the rubric you want to attach
3. Click **Add Selected**
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm and save">
Verify that your rubric now appears under the Rubrics section. Click **Save and Close** to finish.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Alternative">
You can also create a new rubric directly while editing an assignment by selecting **Create New Rubric** instead of **Add Existing**. This is useful if you need a unique rubric for a specific assignment.
</Callout>

## Attaching Rubrics to Discussions

Rubrics can be attached to discussion topics (not forums or threads) to grade student participation and contributions. This is particularly useful for discussions that require thoughtful, substantive posts.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Discussions">
Go to **Activities > Discussions** (or **Tools > Discussions**) in your course navbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Locate your discussion topic">
Find the discussion topic you want to attach a rubric to. Remember that rubrics can only be attached to **topics**, not to forums or individual threads.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit the topic">
Click the arrow icon next to the discussion topic and select **Edit Topic**.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the Assessment tab">
In the topic editor, click on the **Assessment** tab to access grading options.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the rubric">
Click **Add Rubric**, then select **Add Existing** from the dropdown options.
</Step>

<Step title="Select and attach">
In the popup window:
1. Find your rubric in the list
2. Check the box next to the rubric you want to use
3. Click **Add Selected**
</Step>

<Step title="Save your changes">
Confirm the rubric is attached, then click **Save and Close**.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Discussion Grading Note">
Only discussion **topics** can be linked to grades and have rubrics attached. Discussion forums and individual threads cannot be assessed directly. Create your discussion structure with gradeable topics in mind.
</Callout>

## Attaching Rubrics to Quizzes

Rubric integration with quizzes in Brightspace works differently than with assignments and discussions. There are important limitations to understand.

<Callout type="warning" title="Quiz Rubric Limitation">
Rubrics cannot be directly added when creating a quiz in Brightspace. However, rubrics can be attached to **written response (long answer) questions** within a quiz, or associated with a separate grade item for manual grading.
</Callout>

### Method 1: Rubrics for Written Response Questions

For quizzes that include essay or short answer questions, you can attach rubrics to those specific question types.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create or edit your quiz">
Go to **Activities > Quizzes** and create a new quiz or edit an existing one.
</Step>

<Step title="Add a written response question">
Add a **Written Response** question type to your quiz.
</Step>

<Step title="Access question options">
In the question editor, look for the rubric attachment option in the question settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach the rubric">
Select your rubric to attach it to the written response question. The rubric will be used when manually grading that specific question.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Using a Separate Grade Item

For quizzes that need holistic rubric assessment (beyond individual questions), create a separate grade item with the rubric attached.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create the quiz">
Build your quiz as normal and configure auto-grading for objective questions (multiple choice, true/false, etc.).
</Step>

<Step title="Create a grade item">
Go to **Grades > Manage Grades** and create a new **Numeric** grade item specifically for the rubric-based assessment.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach the rubric to the grade item">
When creating the grade item, click **Add Rubric** and select your rubric.
</Step>

<Step title="Grade separately">
After students complete the quiz, enter grades through the Grade Book using the rubric on the separate grade item.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Workaround Consideration">
With this method, the grade item is not directly connected to the quiz submissions. You will need to manually view quiz responses and enter grades into the separate grade item. Consider using a calculated grade item to combine quiz scores with rubric scores if needed.
</Callout>

## Grading with Rubrics

Once a rubric is attached to an activity, you can use it to evaluate student submissions efficiently and consistently.

### Grading Assignments with Rubrics

<Steps>
<Step title="Access submissions">
Go to **Activities > Assignments** and click on your assignment. Select **View Submissions** or click directly on the submissions count.
</Step>

<Step title="Open a student submission">
Click on a student's name or their submission to open it for evaluation.
</Step>

<Step title="Expand the rubric">
Look for the rubric dropdown or panel above the feedback area. Click to expand it and view all criteria.
</Step>

<Step title="Score each criterion">
For each criterion in the rubric:
1. Click on the appropriate performance level
2. The points for that level will populate the Criterion Score column
3. Optionally add specific feedback for that criterion
</Step>

<Step title="Review the total">
As you select levels, the rubric total updates automatically. You can manually adjust individual criterion scores if needed (for partial credit).
</Step>

<Step title="Add overall feedback">
Below the rubric, add any general comments or feedback in the Overall Feedback area.
</Step>

<Step title="Close and transfer the grade">
Click **Close** when finished with the rubric. The grade automatically transfers to the assignment score field.
</Step>

<Step title="Publish the grade">
Click **Update** or **Publish** to save and release the grade and feedback to the student.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="danger" title="Complete All Criteria">
You must select a level for each criterion in the rubric before publishing. If you miss any criterion, Brightspace will prompt: "Not all rubric criteria have been scored - Publish anyway?" If you proceed, students will only see the score, not the completed rubric or your feedback.
</Callout>

### Grading Discussions with Rubrics

<Steps>
<Step title="Open discussion assessment">
Go to **Activities > Discussions**, click the arrow next to your discussion topic, and select **Assess Topic**.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure view options">
Under View Options, select **Show Topic Scores** to see all students and their current scores.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a student">
Click on **Topic Score** next to the student you want to grade.
</Step>

<Step title="Use the interactive rubric">
The rubric appears in a panel above the Overall Grade and Feedback fields:
1. Click the appropriate performance level for each criterion
2. Points automatically populate in the Criterion Score column
3. Add feedback for individual criteria as needed
</Step>

<Step title="Enter overall feedback">
Add general comments about the student's discussion participation in the feedback area.
</Step>

<Step title="Publish the assessment">
Click **Publish** to save the grade and make it visible to the student. You will return to the Assess Topics page to continue grading other students.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Partial Credit">
You can award partial marks between rubric levels by manually editing the Criterion Score. For example, if Level 2 is worth 2 points and Level 3 is worth 3 points, you can enter 2.5 to award partial credit.
</Callout>

## Overall Score vs. Rubric Score

Brightspace rubrics include two different score types that can sometimes cause confusion:

### Total Score (Rubric Score)

The **Total Score** is calculated as the sum of all criterion scores. As you select levels for each criterion, the points are added together to create the total.

- Automatically calculated based on your selections
- Reflects the accumulated points from all criteria
- Can be manually overridden if needed

### Overall Score

The **Overall Score** is an additional interpretive row at the bottom of analytic rubrics that translates the total points into achievement levels (like letter grades or performance categories).

- Automatically determined based on the total score
- Shows achievement levels like "Excellent," "Proficient," "Developing," etc.
- Provides context for what the numerical score means
- Includes customizable feedback for each level

<Callout type="info" title="When to Use Overall Score">
The Overall Score is most useful when you want to communicate achievement levels to students beyond just points. Configure the Overall Score levels to match your course grading scheme (A, B, C, D, F or similar) so students understand where their work falls.
</Callout>

### Manual Override

Both the Total Score and Overall Score can be manually overridden during grading:

1. After completing the rubric, locate the score fields
2. Click on the score you want to change
3. Enter your adjusted value
4. Click **Clear Override** if you want to revert to the calculated score

## Rubric Feedback During Grading

Rubrics in Brightspace support multiple levels of feedback to help students understand their performance.

### Criterion-Level Feedback

Each criterion can have:

- **Pre-set level feedback**: Defined when creating the rubric (appears automatically when you select a level)
- **Custom feedback**: Additional comments you add for a specific student during grading

To add custom criterion feedback:
1. Select the performance level for the criterion
2. Look for the feedback text area below the criterion
3. Enter your specific comments for the student

### Overall Feedback

In addition to criterion-level feedback, you can provide:

- **General comments**: Overall thoughts on the submission
- **Audio/video feedback**: Use Video Note to record personalized feedback
- **Inline annotations**: Mark up the submission directly (for assignments)

<Callout type="tip" title="Effective Feedback">
Combine pre-set rubric feedback with personalized comments. The rubric levels explain the standards, while your custom comments address specific strengths and areas for improvement in the student's work.
</Callout>

## How Scores Transfer to Gradebook

Understanding how rubric scores flow to the gradebook helps you set up your course correctly.

### Automatic Grade Transfer

When you grade an activity with an attached rubric:

1. Complete all criterion scores in the rubric
2. Close the rubric (for assignments) or publish (for discussions)
3. The total rubric score automatically populates the activity grade
4. If the activity is linked to a grade item, the score transfers to the gradebook

<Callout type="info" title="Brightspace vs. Turnitin Rubrics">
A key advantage of Brightspace rubrics over Turnitin rubrics: both the feedback and the rubric score automatically transfer to Grades after assessment. Turnitin rubrics require separate grade entry.
</Callout>

### Requirements for Grade Transfer

For rubric scores to transfer to the gradebook:

1. The activity (assignment or discussion) must be linked to a grade item
2. All criteria in the rubric must be scored
3. The grade must be published (not saved as draft)

### Grade Items and Rubrics

You can attach rubrics directly to grade items for activities that do not have built-in rubric support:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Grades">
Go to **Grades > Manage Grades** in your course.
</Step>

<Step title="Create or edit a grade item">
Create a new Numeric grade item or edit an existing one.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the rubric">
In the grade item settings, click **Add Rubric** and select your rubric.
</Step>

<Step title="Grade from the gradebook">
When entering grades, click the assessment icon to open the rubric and score the student's work.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Student View of Rubric Feedback

Students can view rubric feedback in several locations within Brightspace.

### Before Submission

If you have made the rubric visible, students can see the rubric before submitting their work:

- On the assignment submission page
- In the discussion topic description
- By clicking on "View Rubric" links

This helps students understand expectations before they begin.

### After Grading

Once you publish grades, students see their rubric feedback in:

1. **Grades Tool**: Navigate to Progress > Grades and click on the graded item
2. **Assignments Tool**: Open the assignment to see submitted work and feedback
3. **Discussions Tool**: View the discussion topic to see rubric scores

### What Students See

When viewing a graded rubric, students can see:

- Each criterion and its description
- The level selected for their work (highlighted or checked)
- Point values for each criterion
- Your feedback comments for each criterion
- The total score and overall score
- Overall feedback you provided

<Callout type="tip" title="Hide Scores Option">
If you check "Hide scores from students" in rubric settings, students will still see which levels were selected (via checkmarks) but will not see numerical point values. The Overall Score level remains visible.
</Callout>

## Detaching Rubrics

Sometimes you may need to remove a rubric from an activity. Proceed carefully, especially if grading has already occurred.

<Callout type="danger" title="Data Loss Warning">
If you remove a rubric from an assignment or discussion that has already been evaluated, you will delete all rubric scores and feedback data for ALL student submissions. This action cannot be undone.
</Callout>

### Detaching from an Assignment

<Steps>
<Step title="Edit the assignment">
Go to **Activities > Assignments**, click the arrow next to the assignment, and select **Edit Assignment**.
</Step>

<Step title="Locate the rubric">
In the Evaluation & Feedback section, find the attached rubric.
</Step>

<Step title="Remove the rubric">
Click the **X** or **Remove** option next to the rubric name.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm removal">
If grades have been entered using this rubric, confirm that you understand the data will be deleted.
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
Click **Save and Close** to apply the changes.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Detaching from a Discussion

<Steps>
<Step title="Edit the discussion topic">
Go to **Activities > Discussions**, click the arrow next to your topic, and select **Edit Topic**.
</Step>

<Step title="Go to Assessment tab">
Click on the **Assessment** tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Remove the rubric">
Click the remove option next to the attached rubric.
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
Click **Save and Close** to confirm.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Discussion Rubrics and Student Feedback">
Do not remove rubrics from discussions if you want students to continue viewing their completed rubric feedback. The rubric must remain attached for feedback to be visible.
</Callout>

## Editing Attached Rubrics

Brightspace has specific rules about editing rubrics after they have been attached and used.

### Rubric Locking

When a rubric is:
- Associated with an activity AND
- Has been used to evaluate at least one submission

The rubric becomes **locked**. This prevents changes that could invalidate existing grades.

### What You CAN Edit on a Locked Rubric

- Criterion descriptions (text only)
- Level descriptions (text only)
- Feedback text

<Callout type="info" title="Text Changes Apply Everywhere">
Changes to text in a locked rubric apply to all past and future assessments using that rubric. Students will see the updated text even for previously graded work.
</Callout>

### What You CANNOT Edit on a Locked Rubric

- Number of criteria
- Number of levels
- Point values
- Criterion order or structure

### Workaround: Copy and Create New

If you need to make structural changes to a rubric that has been used:

<Steps>
<Step title="Archive the original rubric">
Go to **Course Admin > Rubrics**, find your rubric, click the dropdown arrow, and change the status to **Archived**.
</Step>

<Step title="Copy the rubric">
Click the dropdown arrow next to the (now archived) rubric and select **Copy**. A copy appears at the top of your rubrics list.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit the copy">
Make your desired changes to the new copy, including structural changes like adding criteria or modifying point values.
</Step>

<Step title="Publish the new rubric">
Set the new rubric status to **Published**.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach to new activities">
Use the new rubric for future activities. The old rubric remains attached to previously graded items, preserving that assessment data.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Rubric Versioning">
Keep archived versions of rubrics you have used for grading. This preserves the historical record of how students were assessed, which can be important for grade disputes or accreditation reviews.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### Before the Semester

- Create and test rubrics before attaching them to activities
- Verify point values match between rubrics and grade items
- Make rubrics visible to students so they understand expectations

### During Grading

- Score ALL criteria before publishing
- Use pre-set feedback to ensure consistency
- Add personalized comments for specific guidance
- Review total scores before publishing to catch errors

### After Grading

- Keep rubrics attached for student reference
- Archive rubrics at the end of the term rather than deleting
- Export or print rubric data if needed for records

## Common Issues

### Rubric score does not match activity grade

- Verify the rubric's total possible points match the activity's "Grade Out Of" value
- Check if you manually overrode the score during grading
- Confirm all criteria were scored

### Students cannot see rubric feedback

- Ensure the grade was published, not saved as draft
- Check that all criteria were scored before publishing
- Verify the rubric visibility settings

### Cannot edit rubric after grading

- The rubric is locked because it has been used for assessment
- Copy the rubric to create an editable version
- Use the copy for future activities

### Rubric not appearing in add rubric list

- Verify the rubric status is Published (not Draft or Archived)
- Check that you are in the correct course
- Refresh the page and try again
