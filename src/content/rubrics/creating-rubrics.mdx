# Creating Rubrics

## Overview

Rubrics are evaluation tools that define clear criteria and performance levels for assessing student work. In Brightspace, rubrics ensure consistent, transparent grading and help students understand exactly what is expected of them before they submit their work.

## Before You Begin

- You need Instructor or TA access to the course
- Decide what aspects of performance you want to assess
- Consider whether you need multiple criteria (analytic) or a single overall assessment (holistic)
- Plan your achievement levels and point distribution

## Understanding Rubric Types

Brightspace offers two types of rubrics, each suited for different assessment needs:

### Analytic Rubrics

Analytic rubrics are **two-dimensional** assessment tools that evaluate student work across multiple criteria. Each criterion is assessed separately, and the scores are combined for an overall grade.

**Best for:**
- Assignments with multiple distinct components
- Providing detailed, criterion-specific feedback
- Assessing complex work like research papers, presentations, or projects

**Example structure:**
| Criteria | Poor (0 pts) | Good (75 pts) | Excellent (125 pts) |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Thesis Statement | Unclear or missing | Present but needs refinement | Clear, specific, arguable |
| Evidence | Little support | Some relevant evidence | Strong, well-integrated evidence |
| Grammar | Many errors | Few errors | Nearly error-free |

### Holistic Rubrics

Holistic rubrics are **one-dimensional** assessment tools that evaluate overall performance against a single set of criteria at different achievement levels.

**Best for:**
- Quick assessments of overall quality
- Simple pass/fail or quality-level evaluations
- When criteria are interdependent and hard to separate

**Example structure:**
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Excellent (90-100%) | Demonstrates mastery of all learning objectives |
| Proficient (70-89%) | Meets most learning objectives with minor gaps |
| Developing (50-69%) | Partial understanding with significant gaps |
| Beginning (0-49%) | Does not meet minimum requirements |

<Callout type="warning" title="Choose Carefully">
Once you save your rubric, you cannot change the rubric type (analytic to holistic or vice versa). Make sure to select the appropriate type before proceeding.
</Callout>

## Creating a New Rubric

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Rubrics Tool">
1. Navigate to your course in Brightspace
2. Click **Course Admin** in the navigation bar
3. Under the **Assessment** section, click **Rubrics**
4. Click **New Rubric** to begin

![Rubrics List](/images/docs/rubrics/rubrics-list.png)
*The Rubrics page showing existing rubrics with status and options to create, edit, or copy.*

You will see a blank rubric template with default levels and criteria.
</Step>

<Step title="Name Your Rubric">
Enter a clear, descriptive name for your rubric at the top of the page. Choose a name that:
- Identifies the assignment or assessment type
- Is easy to find later (e.g., "Research Paper Rubric" or "Discussion Post Evaluation")

![Rubric Editor](/images/docs/rubrics/rubrics-editor.png)
*The rubric editor showing criteria rows, achievement level columns, and scoring options.*

The rubric will auto-save as you make changes, so there is no separate save button.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Rubric Type">
Use the dropdown menu to choose between:
- **Analytic** - Multiple criteria, each assessed separately
- **Holistic** - Single criterion with achievement levels

For most assignments, **Analytic** is recommended as it provides more detailed feedback to students.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Scoring Method">
Select a scoring method from the dropdown:

**For Analytic Rubrics:**
- **Points** - Each level has the same point value across all criteria (e.g., Level 1 = 25 pts for all criteria)
- **Custom Points** - Each criterion can have different point values per level (most flexible)
- **No Score** - Text-only feedback without numerical grades

**For Holistic Rubrics:**
- **Percentages** - Each level corresponds to a percentage of the total grade
- **No Score** - Text-only feedback

<Callout type="tip" title="Recommended Scoring">
**Custom Points** is often the best choice for analytic rubrics because it allows you to weight criteria differently. For example, "Thesis Quality" might be worth more points than "Formatting."
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Criteria (Rows)

Criteria are the aspects of performance you want to assess (the rows in your rubric).

<Steps>
<Step title="Rename Default Criteria">
Click on the default criterion name and replace it with your first assessment area. For example:
- Thesis Statement
- Use of Evidence
- Organization
- Grammar and Mechanics
</Step>

<Step title="Add Additional Criteria">
Click **+ Add Criterion** at the bottom of the rubric to add more rows. Each criterion should:
- Focus on one specific aspect of the assignment
- Be clearly distinguishable from other criteria
- Align with your learning objectives
</Step>

<Step title="Add Criterion Descriptions">
For each criterion, click to add a description that explains:
- What this criterion assesses
- Why it matters for the assignment
- What students should focus on

Descriptions can be up to 500 characters and help students understand expectations.
</Step>

<Step title="Organize with Criteria Groups (Optional)">
For complex rubrics, you can organize related criteria into groups:
1. Click **Add Criteria Group**
2. Name the group (e.g., "Content" or "Technical Skills")
3. Add criteria within each group

This creates multiple matrices within one rubric and helps organize extensive assessments.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Copying Criteria">
To duplicate an existing criterion, click the three-dot menu next to the criterion name and select **Copy Row**. This saves time when creating similar criteria.
</Callout>

## Adding Achievement Levels (Columns)

Achievement levels define the quality scale for assessment (the columns in your rubric).

<Steps>
<Step title="Customize Default Levels">
Brightspace starts with four default levels. Click on each level name to rename it with descriptive labels such as:
- Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement
- Mastery, Proficient, Developing, Beginning
- Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, Approaching, Below Expectations
</Step>

<Step title="Adjust the Number of Levels">
- **Add levels:** Click the **+** button on either side of existing levels to insert a new column
- **Remove levels:** Click the trash bin icon on a level to delete it

Most rubrics use 3-5 levels. Too many levels can make grading decisions difficult.
</Step>

<Step title="Reorder Levels">
By default, levels are arranged from lowest to highest (left to right). Use the **Reverse Level Order** option in the toolbar if you prefer highest to lowest.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Point Values

<Steps>
<Step title="Assign Points to Each Level">
Click on the point value field for each level and enter the appropriate number:

**For Points scoring:**
- Enter the same value for each level across all criteria
- Example: Level 4 = 100 pts, Level 3 = 75 pts, Level 2 = 50 pts, Level 1 = 25 pts

**For Custom Points scoring:**
- Enter unique values for each criterion at each level
- Example: "Thesis" might be 0/15/25/40 while "Grammar" is 0/5/10/15
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Overall Score Thresholds">
Below the criteria, you will find the **Overall Score** section. Configure minimum point thresholds for each performance level:

1. Enter the minimum points required to achieve each level
2. The system will automatically calculate level assignments based on total rubric scores
3. Add feedback text for each overall level to describe general performance
</Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Descriptions for Each Cell

Each cell in your rubric (the intersection of a criterion and a level) should have a clear description.

<Steps>
<Step title="Write Level-Specific Descriptions">
Click on each cell and add text that describes:
- What performance at this level looks like
- Specific characteristics that distinguish this level from others
- Observable behaviors or qualities students should demonstrate

**Example for "Use of Evidence" criterion:**
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Excellent | Uses 5+ credible sources; evidence directly supports all claims; seamless integration of quotes |
| Good | Uses 3-4 credible sources; evidence supports most claims; quotes are generally well-integrated |
| Satisfactory | Uses 2-3 sources; some evidence supports claims; quotes may feel disconnected |
| Needs Improvement | Uses 0-1 sources; evidence is missing or irrelevant; no integration of outside material |
</Step>

<Step title="Add Initial Feedback (Optional)">
For each cell, you can also add **Initial Feedback** that will automatically appear when you select that level during grading. This saves time by pre-populating comments you frequently give.

Access this by clicking on the cell and entering text in the feedback field.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Writing Effective Descriptions">
Use specific, observable language rather than vague terms. Instead of "Good understanding," write "Correctly applies three key concepts from the unit." This helps both graders and students understand expectations.
</Callout>

## Rubric Visibility Settings

Control when and how students see your rubric.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Visibility Options">
Click **Options** to expand the visibility settings panel.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Visibility Level">
Select one of three options:

1. **Rubric is visible to students** - Students can see the empty rubric before submitting and view their graded rubric after assessment
2. **Rubric is hidden until feedback is published** - Students only see the rubric after you release grades
3. **Rubric is hidden from students** - Only instructors, TAs, and graders can see the rubric

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
Making rubrics visible to students before submission helps them understand expectations and often improves the quality of their work. Consider sharing rubrics in advance for major assignments.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Score Visibility">
Optionally check **Hide scores from students** to show only checkmarks indicating selected levels without displaying numerical point values. This is useful when you want students to focus on qualitative feedback rather than points.
</Step>

<Step title="Add a Description (Optional)">
Add an overall rubric description that explains how the rubric will be used and any special instructions for students.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Rubric Status: Draft, Published, and Archived

Rubrics have three possible statuses that control how they can be used.

### Draft Status
- **Default status** for new rubrics
- Can be fully edited (criteria, levels, points, descriptions)
- **Cannot** be attached to assignments, discussions, or grade items

### Published Status
- Required to use the rubric for grading
- Can be attached to activities
- **Cannot** be structurally edited (no adding/removing criteria or changing point values)
- Can only edit text descriptions and wording

### Archived Status
- Rubric is retired but preserved for historical records
- Remains viewable in previously linked activities
- Cannot be attached to new activities

<Steps>
<Step title="Publish Your Rubric">
To change status from Draft to Published:
1. Click on the **Properties** tab (or access settings)
2. Change the **Status** dropdown from "Draft" to "Published"
3. The rubric is now available to attach to assessments
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Locked After Use">
Once a rubric has been used to assess student work, it becomes **locked** and cannot be edited at all. If you need to make changes, you must create a copy of the rubric, edit the copy, and attach the new version to future assignments.
</Callout>

## Copying and Reusing Rubrics

Save time by copying existing rubrics rather than creating new ones from scratch.

<Steps>
<Step title="Copy an Existing Rubric">
1. Go to **Course Admin** > **Rubrics**
2. Find the rubric you want to copy
3. Click the dropdown arrow or three-dot menu next to the rubric
4. Select **Copy**
5. A new rubric is created with "(Copy)" appended to the name
6. Edit the copy as needed
</Step>

<Step title="Reuse Rubrics Across Courses">
Rubrics can be shared with other organizational units (courses):
1. Open the rubric you want to share
2. Access sharing settings
3. Select the courses or organization units to share with
4. The rubric becomes available in those courses

Alternatively, when copying a course, rubrics are typically included in the copy operation.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Rubric Design

### Keep It Focused
- Limit analytic rubrics to 4-6 criteria maximum
- Each criterion should assess one specific skill or outcome
- Avoid overlapping criteria that might double-count the same performance

### Use Clear, Specific Language
- Write descriptions that are observable and measurable
- Avoid vague terms like "good," "adequate," or "appropriate"
- Specify quantities when possible (e.g., "Uses at least 3 sources")

### Maintain Consistency
- Use parallel language structure across all levels
- Ensure clear distinctions between adjacent levels
- Align point distributions with the importance of each criterion

### Test Before Deploying
- Review the rubric from a student's perspective
- Have a colleague review for clarity
- Consider piloting with a sample submission before using widely

### Communicate Expectations
- Share rubrics with students before they begin work
- Explain how each criterion relates to learning objectives
- Be available to answer questions about expectations

<Callout type="info" title="Attaching Rubrics">
After creating your rubric, you can attach it to:
- **Assignments (Dropbox folders)** - See [Attaching Rubrics to Assignments](/docs/rubrics/attaching-to-assignments)
- **Discussions** - See [Attaching Rubrics to Discussions](/docs/rubrics/attaching-to-discussions)
- **Grade Items** - For manual grading activities

Note: Quizzes, Surveys, and Self-Assessments do not support rubric attachment.
</Callout>

## Common Issues

### Cannot Edit Published Rubric
**Solution:** Change the status back to Draft to make edits. However, if the rubric has been used for grading, you must create a copy and edit the copy instead.

### Rubric Not Appearing in Assignment
**Solution:** Ensure the rubric status is set to Published. Draft and Archived rubrics cannot be attached to activities.

### Students Cannot See Rubric
**Solution:** Check the visibility settings under Options. Ensure "Rubric is visible to students" is selected, or that "Rubric is hidden until feedback is published" is set and grades have been released.

### Need to Change Rubric Type
**Solution:** You cannot change between analytic and holistic after creation. Create a new rubric with the correct type and delete the old one if it hasn't been used.
