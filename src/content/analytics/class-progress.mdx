# Using Class Progress

## Overview

The Class Progress tool in Brightspace provides a centralized dashboard for monitoring how students are engaging with your course. It helps instructors, advisors, and support staff track learner activity, identify at-risk students early, and celebrate achievements. By measuring completion of different progress indicators, you can gain actionable insights into student performance and intervene before problems escalate.

## Before You Begin

- You must have instructor or TA access to the course
- The Class Progress tool must be enabled in your course navbar (contact your administrator if it is not visible)
- For content completion tracking to work, content must be marked as "Required" (not the default "Not required" setting)

<Callout type="info" title="Important Note">
Login History in Class Progress tracks logins to the Brightspace system, not specifically to your course. For course-specific access data, check the individual student progress view which includes a Course Access indicator.
</Callout>

## Accessing Class Progress

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Class Progress">
From your course navbar, click **Class Progress**. If you do not see it in the navbar, go to **Course Admin** and select **Class Progress** from the available tools.
</Step>

<Step title="View the Dashboard">
The Class Progress dashboard displays a table showing all enrolled students with four progress indicators. By default, you will see:
- Content Completion Summary
- Objectives Completion Summary
- Login History (Last 30 Days)
- Grades Performance Summary

<Step title="Filter by Group or Section">
Use the filter dropdown at the top of the page to view specific groups or sections. This is helpful for large classes or when you want to focus on particular student cohorts.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Progress Indicators

### Default Indicators

| Indicator | What It Shows |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Content Completion Summary** | How many required content topics each student has completed |
| **Objectives Completion Summary** | Student progression through assigned learning objectives |
| **Login History (Last 30 Days)** | Number of times the student logged into Brightspace (system-wide) |
| **Grades Performance Summary** | Current final grade and visualization of scores for the last 15 grade items |

### Additional Available Indicators

You can replace any default indicator with these alternatives:

- **Assignments Performance Summary** - Average scores and last 15 assignment submissions
- **Checklist Completion Summary** - Progress through checklists with 7-day deadline highlighting
- **Content Visited Summary** - Which topics students have accessed (even if not completed)
- **Discussions Participation Summary** - Reading, posting, and responding statistics
- **Quiz Performance Summary** - Quiz averages and last 15 quiz scores
- **Survey Completion Summary** - Student progression through course surveys
- **System Access (Last 30 Days)** - Browser and app usage patterns

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
Choose indicators that align with your course design. If discussions are a major component, include Discussion Participation. If your course is content-heavy, prioritize Content Completion and Content Visited.
</Callout>

## Customizing the Dashboard

Only 4 indicators can display at one time. To customize your view:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Settings">
Click the **Settings** button while in the Class Progress tool.
</Step>

<Step title="Modify Indicators">
For each indicator column, click the dropdown arrow to access options:
- **Move Up / Move Down** - Reorder the columns
- **Replace** - Swap this indicator for a different one
</Step>

<Step title="Save Changes">
Click **Save and Close** to apply your customizations. Your settings will persist for future visits.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing Individual Student Progress

<Steps>
<Step title="Select a Student">
Click on a student's name or profile thumbnail in the Class Progress dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Progress Summary">
The individual view shows the complete Progress Summary for that student, displaying all available indicators (not just the four on the dashboard). This includes the **Course Access** indicator, which shows how often the student specifically accesses your course.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate Between Students">
Use the arrows below the student's profile name to move to the next or previous student without returning to the main dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Contact the Student">
Hover over the student's profile image to quickly **Send Email** or **Send Instant Message** directly from the progress view.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Content Completion Tracking

For content to appear in progress calculations, three conditions must be met:

1. **Learner Access** - The student must have access to the content
2. **Required Status** - The content must be marked as "Required Automatic" or "Required Manual"
3. **Not Exempt** - The content must not be exempt for that student

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Pitfall">
By default, all content in Brightspace is set to "Not required." If you want to track content completion, you must manually change each module/unit or topic to "Required." Without this setting, the Content Completion indicator will show incomplete data.
</Callout>

### Setting Content as Required

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Content">
Go to **Content** in your course navbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Module/Unit Settings">
Click the module/unit or topic you want to track, then click the settings icon or select **Edit Properties**.
</Step>

<Step title="Set Completion Tracking">
Under completion tracking options, select either:
- **Required - Automatic** (system marks complete when student views the item)
- **Required - Manual** (student must manually mark the item as complete)
</Step>

<Step title="Save and Repeat">
Save your changes and repeat for all content you wish to track.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Identifying At-Risk Students

Use Class Progress to identify students who may need intervention by watching for these warning signs:

### Key Warning Indicators

- **Low Login Frequency** - Students who have not logged in recently or show declining login patterns
- **Incomplete Content** - Students significantly behind on required content completion
- **Declining Grades** - A downward trend in recent grade items
- **No Discussion Activity** - Students not participating in required discussions
- **Missing Assignments** - Patterns of late or missing assignment submissions

<Callout type="tip" title="Proactive Intervention">
Pair Class Progress monitoring with Brightspace's **Intelligent Agents** to automate outreach. You can create agents that automatically send emails to students who meet certain criteria (for example, no login in 7 days or grade below 70%).
</Callout>

### Best Practices for Early Intervention

1. **Check progress weekly** - Regular monitoring helps you catch issues before they become serious
2. **Focus on trends** - A single missed login is not concerning, but a pattern of disengagement is
3. **Use filters** - Focus on specific groups if you have identified at-risk populations
4. **Document your outreach** - Keep notes when you contact struggling students
5. **Offer resources** - When reaching out, provide specific help resources (tutoring, office hours, etc.)

## Generating Progress Reports

While there is no direct export button for Class Progress data, you can access progress information through several methods:

### Viewing Summary Data

The Class Progress dashboard itself serves as a visual report. You can:
- Screenshot the dashboard for documentation
- Print the page using your browser's print function

### Alternative Data Sources

For more detailed reporting needs:

- **Grades Export** - Export grade data to CSV or Excel from the Gradebook
- **Data Hub** (Administrator access required) - Use the Learner Progress Advanced Dataset for comprehensive data
- **Insights Portal** (if Performance+ is enabled) - Access detailed engagement dashboards

<Callout type="info" title="Feature Request">
Direct export of Class Progress data has been requested through D2L's Product Idea Exchange. Check with your Brightspace administrator for updates on this feature.
</Callout>

## Performance+ Analytics (If Available)

Some institutions have access to **Brightspace Performance+**, an advanced analytics add-on that provides additional capabilities beyond the standard Class Progress tool.

### Student Success System

Performance+ includes predictive analytics that can:
- **Predict final grades** - Machine learning models estimate how each student will finish the course
- **Identify at-risk students automatically** - The system flags students likely to struggle before problems appear
- **Suggest interventions** - Recommendations for actions to help struggling learners

### Insights Portal

If your institution has Performance+, you may have access to:
- **Engagement Dashboard** - Quickly identify disengaged students
- **Time-in-Content Analytics** - See how long students spend on course materials
- **Comparative Visualizations** - Win-loss charts comparing individual student performance to class averages

### Course Overview Widget

Performance+ clients can add a **Course Overview** widget to their course homepage, providing at-a-glance analytics directly on the main course page.

<Callout type="info" title="Check Availability">
Performance+ is a separately licensed add-on. Contact your Brightspace administrator to find out if your institution has access to these features.
</Callout>

## Important Limitations

Keep these limitations in mind when using Class Progress:

- **Time estimates are approximate** - Time spent viewing content is a "best estimate" due to browser configurations and ad-blockers. D2L recommends using time data as a diagnostic tool only, not for assessment purposes.
- **Login data covers 30 days** - Login History only shows the last 30 days, not total historical logins.
- **System vs. Course logins** - Standard Login History shows Brightspace system access, not course-specific access. Use the individual student view for Course Access data.
- **50 student limit** - The dashboard may only show 50 students at a time. For larger classes, you may need to use filters or scroll/paginate.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Content Completion shows 0% for all students | Check that your content is marked as "Required" |
| Class Progress is not in my navbar | Go to Course Admin to access it, or ask your admin to add it to the navbar |
| Login data seems inaccurate | Remember this shows system logins, not course-specific access |
| Cannot see all students | Use filters or check pagination; some views limit to 50 students |
| Time spent data seems wrong | Time tracking is approximate; do not use for grading purposes |
