# Content Completion Tracking

## Overview

Content Completion Tracking in Brightspace allows instructors to monitor how students engage with course materials. By setting completion requirements on content items, you can track student progress, create prerequisite learning paths, and identify students who may be falling behind.

This guide covers how to set up completion tracking, the difference between automatic and manual completion, how to view completion data, and best practices for using this feature effectively.

## Before You Begin

- You must have Instructor or TA access to the course
- Content items must already exist before you can configure completion tracking
- The Class Progress tool should be enabled in your course navbar for viewing completion reports
- Plan your completion strategy before configuring (which items should be required vs optional)

<Callout type="info" title="Default Setting">
By default, all content in Brightspace is set to "Not Required." If you want to track content completion, you must manually change each module/unit or topic to "Required." Without this setting, completion data will not be collected.
</Callout>

## Understanding Completion Types

Brightspace offers three completion tracking options for each content item:

### Required: Automatic

The system automatically marks content as complete when students interact with it. This is the recommended option for most content types.

**How automatic completion works for different content:**

| Content Type | Marked Complete When... |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| **HTML pages/Documents** | Student views the page |
| **Links** | Student clicks the link |
| **Files (PDF, Word, etc.)** | Student opens/views the file |
| **Discussions** | Student makes their first post |
| **Assignment folders** | Student submits at least once |
| **Quizzes** | Student submits an attempt |
| **Surveys** | Student submits a response |

<Callout type="warning" title="External Tools Limitation">
External Learning Tools such as Kaltura, BigBlueButton, H5P, and Zoom are not included in automatic completion tracking. Use manual completion for these content types.
</Callout>

### Required: Manual

Students must manually click a checkbox to mark the item as complete. Use this when:

- Automatic tracking does not apply (external tools, offline activities)
- Discussions require multiple posts before students should mark complete
- You want students to self-assess whether they understood the material
- The activity involves reflection or external work

### Not Required (Optional)

No completion tracking is recorded. The item will not appear in progress calculations or affect the progress bar. Use this for:

- Supplementary or bonus materials
- Reference resources students may revisit
- Content that does not affect course progression

## Setting Up Completion Tracking

### Configuring Individual Topics

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Content">
From your course navbar, click **Content** to access the content area.
</Step>

<Step title="Locate the content item">
Click on the module/unit containing the topic you want to configure, then find the specific topic.
</Step>

<Step title="Access the completion setting">
Click the **double dash (--) icon** to the right of the topic title. This opens the completion dropdown menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Select the completion type">
Choose one of the three options:
- **Required - Automatic**: System tracks completion automatically

- **Not Required**: No tracking for this item
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm the change">
The icon updates to reflect the new status:
- **Checkmark**: Required content
- **Double dash**: Not required content
</Step>
</Steps>

### Setting Completion for an Entire Module/Unit

You can set the same completion type for all topics within a module/unit at once.

- **Visited Content Topic**: Requires visiting (but not necessarily completing) a topic
- **Visited All Content Topics**: Requires visiting all topics in a module/unit
</Step>

<Step title="Select the prerequisite">
Choose the specific topic that must be completed before this content unlocks.
</Step>

<Step title="Save the condition">
Click **Create** then **Save** to apply the release condition.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Sequential Learning Paths">

</Step>
</Steps>

## Student View of Progress

Understanding how students see their completion progress helps you design better tracking.

### What Students See

When completion tracking is enabled, students experience:

- **Progress bar**: A visual bar at the top of each module/unit showing completion percentage
- **Checkmarks**: A checkmark icon appears next to completed topics
- **Count indicators**: Numbers beside each module/unit showing remaining items to complete
- **Black dots**: Uncompleted items display a dot instead of a checkmark
- **Class Progress page**: Students can view their overall completion summary

### Student Actions for Manual Completion

For items set to **Required - Manual**:

1. Students see a checkbox next to the topic title
2. After engaging with the content, they click the checkbox
3. The checkmark turns solid to indicate completion
4. Progress bars and counts update automatically

<Callout type="warning" title="Manual Completion Limitation">
Students can mark manual items as complete without actually engaging with the content. This does not affect quiz scores or assignment submissions, but it does affect progress tracking. Consider this when deciding between automatic and manual completion.
</Callout>

## Completion Tracking vs Grades

Understanding the difference between completion tracking and grades helps you use each appropriately.

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Completion Tracking | Grades |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| **What it measures** | Engagement and access | Quality of work/performance |
| **How it is recorded** | Automatic or student-initiated | Instructor-assigned scores |
| **Where it appears** | Class Progress, progress bars | Gradebook |
| **Student control** | Can mark manual items complete | Cannot change their grades |
| **Assessment impact** | No effect on scores | Directly affects final grade |

### When to Use Each

**Use Completion Tracking for:**
- Monitoring if students are engaging with materials
- Creating prerequisites and learning paths
- Identifying disengaged students early
- Tracking progress through non-graded content

**Use Grades for:**
- Evaluating the quality of student work
- Calculating final course grades
- Providing performance feedback
- Meeting institutional assessment requirements

<Callout type="info" title="They Work Together">
Completion tracking and grades are complementary. A student might complete a quiz (completion tracking) and then receive a score (grade). Both pieces of data appear in Class Progress, giving you a complete picture of student engagement and performance.
</Callout>

## Best Practices for Completion Tracking

### Planning Your Tracking Strategy

- **Identify essential content**: Not everything needs to be tracked. Focus on core learning materials.
- **Use automatic when possible**: Reduces student burden and ensures accurate tracking
- **Reserve manual for special cases**: Use only when automatic tracking cannot work
- **Communicate expectations**: Tell students what is required and how completion affects their access

### Setting Up Effective Tracking

- **Be consistent within modules/units**: Use the same completion type for similar content
- **Check settings after course copy**: Verify completion settings transferred correctly
- **Test the student experience**: Use View as Student or a test account to see how tracking works
- **Review external tools**: Remember that LTI tools and external links may not track automatically

### Using Tracking Data Effectively

- **Check regularly**: Review completion data weekly to catch struggling students early
- **Focus on patterns**: One incomplete item is not concerning; consistent incompletion is
- **Use with Intelligent Agents**: Automate outreach to students falling behind on completion
- **Do not use for assessment**: Time and completion data are for engagement insights, not grading

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes to Avoid">
- **Forgetting to set items as Required**: The default "Not Required" means no tracking occurs
- **Overusing manual completion**: Students may mark complete without engaging
- **Ignoring external tool limitations**: LTI tools and embedded content often do not track
- **Using completion for grades**: Completion is about access, not assessment quality
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Completion always shows 0% | Content set to "Not Required" | Change to "Required - Automatic" or "Required - Manual" |
| Some students show incomplete but claim they finished | External tool or link did not track | Use manual completion or different content format |
| Progress bar not updating | Browser cache issue | Have student refresh or clear cache |
| Completion reset unexpectedly | Changed from automatic to manual | Resetting is expected; students must re-complete manually |
| Student marked complete without doing work | Manual completion allows this | Switch to automatic if possible, or accept this limitation |
| Time spent data seems wrong | Approximate tracking only | Do not use time data for assessment; use for engagement insights only |
