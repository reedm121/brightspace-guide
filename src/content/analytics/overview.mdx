# Class Progress

## What is Class Progress?

**Class Progress** is Brightspace's built-in analytics tool that helps you monitor student engagement and performance. It provides insights into how students are interacting with your course—who's logging in, what content they're viewing, how they're performing on assessments, and who might be falling behind.

Think of Class Progress as your early warning system for identifying students who may need additional support.

## Why Use Class Progress?

Tracking student engagement helps you intervene before problems escalate:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Early Intervention** | Identify struggling students before they fail |
| **Engagement Insights** | See who's accessing course materials |
| **Performance Patterns** | Spot trends across assignments and quizzes |
| **Content Analysis** | Learn which materials students actually use |
| **Individual Tracking** | Deep-dive into any student's activity |
| **Data-Driven Decisions** | Make informed choices about course design |

<Callout type="tip" title="Proactive Teaching">
Research shows that early intervention dramatically improves student outcomes. Reaching out to a disengaged student in week 3 is far more effective than waiting until week 10.
</Callout>

## What Class Progress Tracks

Class Progress monitors several types of student activity:

### Access Patterns
- Last login date and time
- Frequency of course visits
- Time spent in the course
- Content items accessed

### Performance Data
- Grade trends over time
- Assignment submission rates
- Quiz scores and attempts
- Discussion participation

### Content Engagement
- Which modules students have viewed
- Completion of required content
- Video watch time (if applicable)
- Resource downloads

### Comparative Analysis
- Student performance vs. class average
- Engagement levels compared to peers
- Progress toward course completion

## Accessing Class Progress

To access Class Progress:

1. From your course navbar, click **Class Progress** (or **Course Admin** > **Class Progress**)
2. You'll see an overview dashboard with class-wide metrics

<Callout type="info" title="Location Varies">
Some institutions place Class Progress under "Tools" or "Course Admin" rather than directly on the navbar. Check with your institution if you can't find it.
</Callout>

## Key Views

### Indicator Comparison
Visual comparison tools showing:
- How students compare to each other
- Performance distribution across the class
- Engagement metrics side-by-side

## Understanding the Indicators

Class Progress uses several indicators to measure student engagement:

| Indicator | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Content Visits** | Number of times student accessed content |
| **Grades** | Current overall grade and grade trend |
| **Submissions** | On-time vs. late vs. missing assignments |
| **Login Activity** | How often student logs in |
| **Discussion Activity** | Posts, replies, and reading in discussions |
| **Time in Course** | Total time spent in Brightspace |

### Indicator Colors
Most views use color coding:
- 🟢 **Green**: On track, no concerns
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Some concerns, monitor closely
- 🔴 **Red**: Significant concerns, intervention needed

## Using Class Progress Effectively

### Weekly Check-In Routine
1. Open Class Progress at the start of each week
2. Sort students by last login date
3. Note anyone who hasn't logged in recently
4. Check for students with declining grades
5. Plan outreach for at-risk students

### Identifying At-Risk Students
Look for these warning signs:
- No login for 7+ days
- Missing multiple assignments
- Declining grade trend
- Low content access compared to peers
- No discussion participation (if required)

### Taking Action
When you identify a struggling student:
- Send a personal email expressing concern
- Offer office hours or support resources
- Check if they're facing external challenges
- Consider using Intelligent Agents for automated outreach

<Callout type="warning" title="Privacy Considerations">
Class Progress data is sensitive. Use it to support students, not to penalize them for not logging in "enough." Some students may access materials in ways that don't register (printed PDFs, study groups, etc.).
</Callout>

## Intelligent Agents Integration

Class Progress pairs well with **Intelligent Agents** for automated intervention:

- Set up agents to email students who haven't logged in for 5 days
- Alert students with missing assignments
- Congratulate students on improved performance
- Remind students about upcoming deadlines

See the [Intelligent Agents guide](/docs/communication/intelligent-agents) for setup instructions.

## Content Completion Tracking

Beyond Class Progress, Brightspace tracks content completion:

### Enabling Completion Tracking
1. Go to **Content**
2. Select a module or topic
3. Set completion criteria (visited, viewed all, manually marked, etc.)

### Using Completion Data
- See which students have finished required readings
- Use completion as a release condition for assessments
- Track progress through learning paths
- Identify bottlenecks where students stop

## Limitations to Know

Class Progress has some limitations:

| Limitation | Workaround |
|------------|------------|
| **Only tracks Brightspace activity** | Students may study from printed materials or with peers |
| **Time tracking is approximate** | Students may leave tabs open without actively studying |
| **Doesn't measure learning** | High engagement doesn't always mean learning occurred |
| **Privacy concerns** | Be thoughtful about how you use surveillance data |

<Callout type="info" title="Activity ≠ Learning">
A student who logs in daily but doesn't complete assignments may be struggling more than a student who logs in weekly but submits excellent work. Use multiple data points to understand the full picture.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### For Monitoring
- Check Class Progress weekly, not obsessively
- Look for trends over time, not single data points
- Compare students to their own history, not just peers
- Don't assume low activity means low effort

### For Intervention
- Reach out with curiosity, not accusation
- Offer support rather than criticism
- Respect that students have lives outside your class
- Follow up after initial contact

### For Course Design
- Use completion data to identify confusing content
- Notice where students stop engaging
- Consider restructuring content that students skip
- Add engaging elements to low-interest sections
