3. **Notification issues** - Students don't receive email notifications by default
4. **Integration complexity** - Third-party tools (McGraw Hill, etc.) can be tricky
5. **Mobile issues** - Toggle menus sometimes block content
6. **Turnitin conflicts** - Track Changes in Word documents cause problems
7. **Video playback** - Login/authentication issues with embedded video
